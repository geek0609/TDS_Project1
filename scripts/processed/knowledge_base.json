You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains. I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.",

A heartfelt thanks to @s.anand, our course instructor, and TAs @Carlton and @Jivraj, whose guidance on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project possible. I’d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to: Expand functionality and evaluation models. Fix bugs and optimize workflows. Improve documentation for broader accessibility. The GitHub repository is open for forks, pull requests, and ideas. I look forward to collaborating with you all!

While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained. Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses. Additionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don’t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials. I would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there’s a better way to balance this. PS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs or mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective. Another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable.",

So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test. Kind regards",

          "content": "Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects. Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical? That said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I’d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently.",

          "content": "Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments: Isolation – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects. Reproducibility – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies. Portability – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering. Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name) • Good for quick experimentation and testing. • Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time. Using requirements.txt • Best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. • Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup. Specifying Versions in requirements.txt • If you don’t specify a version, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes. • If you do specify a version (package==1.2.3), you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues. Handling Version Conflicts • If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall. • Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider: • Using greater than/less than constraints: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes). • Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment. Best Practices Summary Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda). Use a requirements.txt file for reproducibility. Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed. Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages. Kind regards",

Whereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine. For project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement 24f2006531: Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? Coming to your second question, The first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s project it’s better to use requirements.txt. 24f2006531: My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation The creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed. Never try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that, pip3 freeze > requirements.txt . This does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you",

          "content": "Hi Hari, The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended. Have you watched this session in particular? If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student. Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding. Kind regards",

Here are the highlights of the discussion: We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday. All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago) Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago) We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it. All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students: Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed. Please make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements. Kind regards TDS Team",

(Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated. Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week. Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here. Thank you.",

          "content": "Hi Vikram, This is because (if you watched the session, or examined the code, you would have realised that) datagen.py was designed to run inside your docker container. And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py Inside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile which then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder. So the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully): You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000 You create a docker image that runs this application server. You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page. For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files: evaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts. Run evalute.py using uv. If your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task. Hope that gives clarity. Kind regards",

There were some issues I faced. For example, the GitHub link of the datagen.py was incorrect and I was confused due to the code not generating the expected outcome. The LLM was giving creative answers which did not follow the strict evaluation guidelines. So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card number from the image is a sensitive information. I am alright with it since the evaluation will be different. Now, I am really well versed with the tools taught in these weeks. Thanking the whole TDS Team for this project which was very well designed.",

Please check into this question once as I have cross checked with many of the students and chatgpt and all of us faced this issue in this question. Thanks! @carlton @s.anand code to take reference from: import gzip import pandas as pd from datetime import datetime log_path = 's-anand.net-May-2024.gz' start_time = datetime.strptime('01:00:00', '%H:%M:%S').time() end_time = datetime.strptime('15:00:00', '%H:%M:%S').time() log_data = [] def parse_log(line): parts = line.split(' ') log_time = datetime.strptime(parts[3][1:], '%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S') method, url, status = parts[5][1:], parts[6], int(parts[8]) return log_time, method, url, status with gzip.open(log_path, 'rt') as file: for entry in file: log_time, method, url, status = parse_log(entry) if method == 'GET' and url.startswith('/blog/') and 200 <= status < 300: if log_time.weekday() == 0 and start_time <= log_time.time() < end_time: log_data.append(entry) print(f\"Successful GET requests: {len(log_data)}\") ps: I shared code after the deadline hopefully no issues there!",

After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds. Here was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed. In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.” The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice. Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind. From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations. Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"",

If your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you… past experience shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome without significant assistance from the “hooomann” So practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard. There will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test. Kind regards",

These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase. We generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started. The GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more. We try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs. Hence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system. Hope that give you some insight into how TDS works. Thanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP. Kind regards",

Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities. The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time. The problem is the lack of time. So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand. Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next. Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE. The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before. But we will help you be as ready as possible for it. Kind regards",

We have provided this for you to test yourself. The expected time to complete this Mock ROE is 45 mins. We will allow access to the Mock ROE and the question form after the live solving session tonight. All the best!",

The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things: The chaos of ROE. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this). The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team. The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well). How limited the time is. The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE. Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us. Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit). I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock. Kind regards",

          "question": "Dear @jkmadathil @Anand @Bharathi First and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TDS team in supporting us throughout this course. The live sessions and guidance have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience. However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations. Key Challenges Faced Lack of Prerequisites This course did not list any prerequisites, leading many students—including those from non-technical backgrounds—to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the course content, assignments, and projects have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage. Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure The difficulty of the projects has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to rely heavily on peer support just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully. Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback Many students joined TDS based on past Discourse posts and feedback, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for working professionals and students without prior experience. Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs) While we have put in significant effort—spending 2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs) to secure good scores—we still find ourselves struggling to meet expectations for the projects and RoE, which are significantly harder than anticipated. We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course. We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed. Thank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.",
          "answer": "Thank you @A_LAKSHMI for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response. Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the grading pattern will not be changed. And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP. TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words: This course is quite hard Here’s students’ feedback: It used to be an easy course until 2024. # # # Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # # Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # # LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # # The ROE is hard. # Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you’re ready for this course. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now. TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help Again to quote Anand: We encourage learning by sharing You CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam). Why should you copy? Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well. To learn well, understand what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize. To learn better, teach what you’ve learnt. Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself). Once again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable and internally make us more humble. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them. @22f2001640 Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.",

          "content": "Hi @s.anand @jkmadathil @Bharathi @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Could you please look into the above issue? Additionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring: Grading Concerns Final Course Score: T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F (The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.) From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students: What’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?. Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores. Furthermore, for Project 1 (deadline: 16th Feb 2025), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1. Course Structuring & Scheduling Issues Many students pursuing this course are dual-degree students or working professionals, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines. The last-minute guidance for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments. The structuring and scheduling of sessions feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time. Request for Improvement To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request: Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2, well in advance of the deadline. More structured and accessible support, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals. Better management of exam difficulty levels, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough. I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response.",

I’ve been running a high fever since yesterday, and while I managed to complete my JAVA OPPE this morning, I started feeling much worse afterward. I felt it was necessary to get checked out by a doctor and unfortunately had to miss ROE as a result. I was wondering if there might be any possibility of taking the ROE at a later time? Please let me know if there’s anything I can do or if any arrangements can be made.",

In Questions 3 and 4, I am unable to obtain an exact answer that matches any of the given options, despite trying multiple approaches, including the Excel regression method and other models in a Google Colab file. The data for Question 10 is missing. I attempted to run the shapefile in QGIS, but it resulted in an error. Additionally, I searched for the shapefile of New York roads on official websites, but their servers are currently under maintenance. The assignment deadline is approaching, but these issues remain unresolved. Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution as soon as possible. Thank you for your support.",

          "question": "@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj Dear TDS Team, I hope you are doing well. I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution. 1. Graded Assignments (GA) GA6 Doubts Unresolved: While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. (Thread link) GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. 2. Project Updates Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 2: There are multiple doubts posted in the Project 2 discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved? (thread link) 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. I appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response. Best regards, Lakshay",
          "answer": "lakshaygarg654: GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations. With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS. GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon. lakshaygarg654: Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing. Each and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway. lakshaygarg654: 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. You got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed. Kind regards",

We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway. lakshaygarg654: 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. You got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed. Kind regards",

We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience. The reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next. We will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100. Meanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated. Looking forward to your response. Regards, Lakshay",

Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos you gave us. For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.

Docker Image Architecture Issue Report If your Docker image was run on the wrong architecture, please fill out this form: Submit Report Bug fixes If you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix.

Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible. These things do matter when done at scale. Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter. Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it. We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page. I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why. Kindest regards",

I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th. I completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it. Thankyou!",

The license file was named properly and contained the correct content. However, I received a message stating that the MIT License was not present, and that the prerequisites were not completed — resulting in a failed status. This is surprising and feels unfair, as I’ve double-checked my submission and confirmed that everything, including the license file, is in place and named correctly. Here is my GitHub repo for your reference: GitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1 I kindly request a re-evaluation of my submission, as I believe I’ve met all the required criteria. I would really appreciate your time in looking into this matter again. Thank you for your understanding. @Jivraj",

However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason? As the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation? Thank you and Regards Akshit",

Module: Data Sourcing Q9: Data API Identification Which of the following data sources is most likely to provide structured data accessible via an API? A. A scanned PDF document B. A screenshot of a chart C. The World Bank data portal D. A newspaper article Answer: C — The World Bank data portal provides structured datasets accessible via APIs. The other options involve unstructured or image-based content not suitable for direct data access. Module: Data Preparation Q10: Data Type Conversion in Excel You imported a CSV file into Excel, and one of the columns containing numbers is treated as text. What is the easiest way to convert it into numeric format? A. Use the CONCAT function B. Format the column as Text C. Use the VALUE() function D. Use SUBSTITUTE() Answer: C — The VALUE function converts text that appears as numbers into actual numeric values. This is useful when data is imported with formatting issues. Module: Data Analysis Q11: Outlier Detection You are analyzing a dataset of employee salaries. Which visualization is best for quickly identifying outliers? A. Line chart B. Box plot C. Histogram D. Pie chart Answer: B — A box plot clearly shows the spread of data and highlights outliers as individual points beyond the whiskers. Module: Large Language Models Q12: Prompt Engineering Strategy To get consistent, structured responses from a language model when extracting key information, which approach is most effective? A. Ask the model to “summarize” the text B. Use open-ended questions C. Use system messages and JSON schema formatting D. Provide only one-word inputs Answer: C — System messages and structured output formats like JSON schemas guide the model to generate reliable and consistent structured responses. Module: Geospatial and Network Analysis Q13: Network Centrality In a social network graph of coworkers, which metric best identifies the person who connects the most groups together? A. Degree centrality B. Closeness centrality C. Betweenness centrality D. Eigenvector centrality Answer: C — Betweenness centrality measures how often a node appears on shortest paths between other nodes, highlighting connectors or “bridges” in the network. Module: Data Visualization Q14: Choosing the Right Chart You want to show how the composition of a marketing budget changes across three years. Which visualization is most appropriate? A. Pie charts for each year B. Scatter plots C. Stacked bar chart D.

          "content": "Hi @carlton and @Jivraj sir, I appeared for the end term examination held on 13th April 2025 during the FN shift. I would like to bring to your attention that the exam interface did not provide an option for multiple selections. However, a few questions appeared to have multiple correct answers. I have noted down the specific questions and the corresponding options I believe to be correct.So, kindly review them and let me know if there were any errors in my understanding of the questions. The questions are as follows: 10000425471080×578 187 KB Question 2: Fields needed to filter “POST requests under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays” To filter such logs, we need: Time → for the hour and the day (Monday) Method → to filter POST URL → to filter /images/ So, the correct minimal set is: Time, Method, URL Time → needed Method → needed URL → needed Referer → not needed, but not harmful So this option includes all the necessary fields, just with one extra — which doesn’t invalidate it. 10000425481080×301 71.5 KB Acc to solutions only option 6406534159827 is valid: Status is numeric (200) Method (GET), Protocol (HTTP/1.1), and URL (/index.html) are correct All required fields are present and properly formatted The other options were as follows: 9825 uses invalid protocol (INVALID) 9826 uses invalid status code (OK instead of numeric) 9824 has no critical issue — it is technically also valid (only uses a private IP 192.168.1.1, which is unusual but not invalid). So both 9824 and 9827 are valid, but the answer marked only 9827 10000425451079×468 35.7 KB Correct Answer(s): PUT – Correct: It replaces the resource entirely. Multiple identical PUTs = same result. GET – Also correct: It only fetches data, no side-effects. Multiple GETs = same result. DELETE – Technically correct: Deleting the same resource multiple times has the same result as deleting once (resource stays deleted). Incorrect Answer: POST – Not idempotent. Each POST usually creates a new resource or changes server state. (This is the mistake on my part that I put the ans as POST as I thought since 3/4 are idempotent and one is not I should select the odd one out but I hope this could be resolved) Thank you",

In that case len(filtered entries) seems to be correct. However the right answer is marked ‘None of these’ . image1108×394 81.9 KB The valid log entry had me stumped too, option 1 and 4 both look absolutely fine yet only option 4 is marked correct. Also, only POST request is not idempotent, all other requests are idempotent yet only PUT is marked correct. Request you to please clarify and consider these points.",

Entries with 404 status code Although the instructions did not explicitly state that filters applied for status code 404, we acknowledge this ambiguity. Full credit will be awarded for both option 1 and option 4. Which of the following fields are necessary to filter “POST requests made for pages under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays”? Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL) is correct because: Option B includes Size and Status, which aren’t needed for filtering by time, method, and URL Option C includes Referer, which is unnecessary unless filtering by source page Option D includes Status and Server, which aren’t relevant for this specific filtering requirement",

          "content": "Thank you for the clarification provided regarding Question 4 and resolution of errors in other questions. I understand the reasoning behind choosing Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL). However, I respectfully believe Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) is more accurate for the following reasons: Redundancy in Option A: The Request field already contains the HTTP method, URL, and protocol (e.g., “POST /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1”). Including both Request and separate Method and URL fields introduces redundancy. If we already extract Method and URL separately for filtering, the full Request field becomes unnecessary. Simplicity in Filtering: Filtering for “POST requests under /images/” from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays can be done using: Time → for checking the hour and weekday. Method → to filter only POST. URL → to ensure the request is under /images/. Thus, Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) already includes all needed fields. While Referer is not essential, it doesn’t interfere with the filtering and might be useful in future extended filtering cases (e.g., source tracking). Therefore, Option C is complete and accurate without being redundant. Consistency with Log Parsing Practices: In most log analysis scripts or systems (e.g., Python’s re or pandas parsing of logs), Method and URL are parsed from Request for separate use. This further supports the idea that including Request alongside Method and URL is not best practice.",

I had briefly read your post and incorrectly assumed that the script was not handling newline characters (which are invisible whitespaces). The prescription given by Anand in a live session exclusively conducted by him was clear. We should be able to copy paste your answer from the JSON response and put it in the GA and it should work. There only some notable exceptions, and this is where formatted text is expected. This question does not require formatted text, but it does require handling of quotes. Your response has literal a \\ and literal n characters. It fails the copy paste test. If it had the invisible actual new line characters encoded then it would be parsed correctly. In your own image that you shared you did not copy paste the return response of your function into your GA. I also looked at your repo and the mistake you made for this question was you used a multiline string for the SQL query. The result of the json.dumps for this question (which does not require or expect formatted text) would end up with \\n that we do not parse. We are only parsing for quotes which our script does handle. As a result, I would like to reiterate, your return fails the copy paste test. Therefore we will not be able to award you marks for this. There are many students who got this correct. I suggest you to check out some of their repos to see why they were able to get the right answer. Kind regards TDS Team",

Furthermore, this exact implementation was previously evaluated successfully and accepted as correct by the evaluation script for Graded Assignment 2, demonstrating its validity. Github repo link : https://23f1001231.github.io/testsite/ image1094×298 61.6 KB image1056×355 37.1 KB image928×161 11.5 KB Video proof below shows my solution as correct and valid by the evaluation script of the Graded Assignment. The error in Project 2 appears to arise from the evaluation script’s handling of the tag—specifically, its use of a regex that fails to detect <!--email_off--> when it follows an <a> element. This is a technical flaw in the evaluation process, not an issue with my solution. The inconsistency between the evaluation scripts for the Graded Assignment and Project 2 has resulted in a correct answer being unfairly marked as incorrect. Such ambiguity in automated evaluation is deeply concerning and leads to confusion and unwarranted penalization of students. Denying marks due to technical discrepancies in the evaluation scripts, rather than the correctness of the submitted solution, is unjust.

          "content": "@carlton @s.anand @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Sir I wanted to respectfully bring to your attention a concern regarding the evaluation of my Project 2 submission. My project is functioning properly in my browser, but it doesn’t use http or https in the URL—it’s accessed directly without a protocol. I believe this might have caused an issue with the evaluation script, rather than an actual error in my submission. I’d like to kindly request that the evaluation script be updated to account for such cases, as the core requirements of the project were fulfilled to the best of my understanding. With due respect, I’ve invested a lot of time and effort into this project, and it’s disheartening to see that a technicality might affect the evaluation. We’ve studied exception handling in both Java and Python—so I was a bit curious (asking respectfully, of course!) why there wasn’t similar handling in the evaluation logic for edge cases like mine. I completely understand the depth of your knowledge, and I say this with all humility—I’m just trying to understand and express a genuine concern. I don’t have professional experience in web or app development, but my cousin, who works in tech, told me that even in real-world projects, bugs can appear after deployment. That’s why we have QA and support teams in companies (or so I’ve been told!). To be honest, I initially thought TDS would be easier compared to Java, PDSA, or SC. Ironically, I’ve cleared all four subjects this term, including both projects—except TDS, where Project 2 has become a bit of a nightmare. Without the Project 2 score, I might end up passing with just an ‘E’ grade, which would hurt my overall CGPA. Worse, I’d have to repeat the course and pay the fee again—which isn’t covered under the CSR fund. So, with the utmost respect and sincerity, I request you to please consider re-evaluating my submission using the updated endpoint. Not just for me, but there are several students whose hopes are resting on this project’s score. Updating the script shouldn’t affect students who already scored well, but it might help a few others avoid repeating the course unnecessarily. I’m not asking for bonus marks or any special treatment—just a fair second look. As a law student (LLB), I deeply respect rules and processes. I only ask this in the spirit of fairness and with full respect for your time and effort. Please consider this message as a humble and respectful request—I’m just exercising my right to politely express a concern.",

Kind regards TDS Team [carlton] (https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)Regular 22h We have made the update to your score and awarded you 4 marks (out of 20) for your endpoint. Kind regards According to the official dashboard, there has been no increase reflected in my Project 2 score, which remains at 20 out of 100. This is inconsistent with your claim that my score has already been updated. I have previously submitted a formal discrepancy form for two questions that were incorrectly evaluated by the Project 2 evaluation script. Furthermore, @carlton has explicitly confirmed that the marks for these questions would be updated. To date, this correction has not been implemented and my score hasn’t updated. The marks in question are not trivial. If the corrections are made as promised, my overall course percentage will increase by a minimum of 6%. This is a substantial change that directly affects my academic record. The assertion that “more marks will not change the grade” overlooks the broader implications of accurate and fair assessment. It is a fundamental principle of academic integrity and fairness that students receive the marks they have rightfully earned. Denying the correction of a clear and acknowledged error constitutes an unjust deprivation of my rightful academic standing. Such actions may not align with the principles of due process. I respectfully request that you to update my Project 2 score to accurately reflect the corrections as confirmed by @carlton , provide a clear clarification of my revised Project 2 score (out of 100) and ensure that my overall course percentage is recalculated accordingly.",

          "content": "Having a coding background, the first GA seemed really easy. So I started the course thinking that it’ll be an easy S grade course for me. Oh how wrong was I!! The sleepless nights cursing my laptop for freezing while my docker image installed huge CUDA libraries with sentence-transformers; and then finding ways to make sure it does not, and then getting rid of the library itself, it’s just one example of how I was forced to become better by finding better solutions to multiple problems. This is one of the hardest, most frustrating and the most satisfying learning experience I’ve ever had, besides learning ML from Arun sir. @s.anand sir did a tremendous job of designing this course. I feel this course ties every other course together by applying learnings from each course and building further upon them. I learnt development in python and APIs in MAD-1, JS in MAD-2, bash scripting in SC, SQL in DBMS, data structures in PDSA and TDS had applications of each. In MAD projects, we made an app and submitted it as zip file. Here we went on to learn to containerise our app and deploy and also make the process automated. Our apps combined python and shell scripting along with the power of LLMs. Yeah the projects did seem extremely overwhelming but the learning is invaluable. @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @carlton I’m sure it wasn’t an easy task being the TA of this course. Thanks for all the help throughout the term with the Mock ROEs, project sessions and clearing doubts in discourse and live sessions. I still got an S grade but it was a very hard-fought S with the help of some luck. I’d love to follow the changes this course goes through in the upcoming terms.

This post reminds me of the farewell post I wrote for my TAs @carlton and @Amit1 back in May’24 term when I was a student of TDS. This course is more of an experience that a student goes through. The sleepless nights for projects, the thrill and rush of the ROE, and the satisfaction of an easy End Term . This course builds the confidence within a person to face challenging scenarios and a believe to come at the top of it. Honestly, I learnt a lot about being a TA in this course. It was an experience worth living. So, thank you Shivaditya, looking at students like you, it feels like our efforts paid off. All the best for your next term. Best Wishes Saransh Saini TDS TA",

I had the technical background and as @22f3000819 mentioned I thought it was going to be an easy ride but I was wrong. It was challenging as well as fun at the same time. The best part of the course is that it is open internet and we are free to explore, use LLMs and get the things done. This way of learning to me is the most effective. I have the guide and now I can devise how I should approach the things. Everything ROE, Project 1, Project 2 was quite challenging and fun at the same time. Projects were the best part of the course. I learned how things can go wrong when we deploy it. I collaborated with @ItsMeAlex , @trebhuvansb , @23f1002382 and @22f3002933 for Project 2. My Project 2 repo even got 17 forks and 4 stars and scored 20/20 on evaluation. This adventure ended with the relaxing end term paper and an overall “S” grade. Also I must say the support team of TDS is the best so far in the program. I had conversation with @Jivraj , @Saransh_Saini and @carlton sir and they are super helpful. I would really miss these sessions. I attended the live sessions by @s.anand sir and sir’s take on the questions were really insightful and even made me think differently than my perspective. When we do something different it ought to have challenges both operational and technical but the TDS support team tried to give its best. Many a times I too had raised concerns but the team tried to resolve it to their best capabilities. At last I would like to say, without any hesitation, I had experienced the best part of the program till now in the last 3-4 months. Hoping to meet the team and my fellow peers in person during the Paradox . Thanks & Regards Pradeep Mondal",

          "content": "My TDS Journey “A Tale of Bugs, Chaos & Miraculous Comebacks” So, I did something bold (or reckless, depends on how you see it)—took the TDS (Tools in Data Science) course right in my first term. Why? Because curiosity got the better of me, and I thought, “Eh, GA1 went fine, how hard could it be?” (Spoiler: Very hard.) Not a decision I recommend unless you’re into academic masochism. The first few modules hit me like three courses merged into one . Maybe because I was totally unprepared, maybe because TDS has a secret pact with chaos. Did all 7 GA …it was very time consuming but fun too …learnt new tools with every question. But hey, the live lectures were fantastic , the modules were well-structured , and thank goodness for the lifesaving Discourse forum and group, where the real MVPs reside . Then came Project 1. Ah yes, my nemesis. I’d write code, it would run perfectly, then—bam! A random error just to keep things from getting doable⚠️. Was it 404? 500? Who knows! I basically developed muscle memory for every error code in existence . The grand result? 2/20. At this point, my grade looked like it had fallen off a cliff , and I wasn’t sure if I could salvage an B—or even a C, honestly… with -18 in my balance due to P1 and a trauma for P2 I couldn’t have expected more… no? Entered the TA sessions and peer-powered survival squad —my saving grace. ROE, the supposedly impossible exam, where I thought even a 50% would be a miracle?..got 100%. Same for Project 2—100%. Even after initially refusing to believe it, reality set in, and my **end-term score also landed around 90 ** (thanks to the PYQs and those 300 github ques…definitely recommending the next term student to solve and understand all the pyqs fr), then wrapping the final score with some gift wrappers of a few bonus marks… this deal got sealed with a confident A … .…drumrolls… An A. This course was brutal, but in the best way possible . It threw me into battles with LLMs, never-ending questions, and existential crises over debugging . But now, I have actual skills (and scars) that I’ll carry into my future projects of MAD1, MAD2, MLP, and BDM which will be a whole new experience🚀. Looking back, the syllabus was a wild mix of survival skills and superpowers—building models, deploying them, wrestling with LLMs, and somehow convincing messy data to behave. And just when we thought we had conquered it all, Project 1 pulled us into the abyss. Now, with Data Analysis and Visualization still in the works, the adventure wasn’t over. Because what’s data science without some surprises and flashy charts to flex? For future students? Take it later in the diploma, enjoy the mad ride, and remember—even if you bomb a project, there can always be a comeback. TDS is tough, but resilience matters more than perfection. Even if you get 10/100(which I got) on a project, learn from it, adapt, and come back stronger. Massive thanks to @s.anand sir for making this learning experience possible, and a special shoutout to @carlton sir, @Saransh_Saini sir, and @Jivraj for patiently resolving our chaotic issues . Your guidance made a challenging journey both rewarding and insightful. Grateful for everything! TDS—difficult, enlightening, and totally worth it. (This gracious furry benefactor granted us a deadline extension—P1 survivors can relate #thanks_to_carlton_sir, we know how crucial that was. So, signing off with a furry and really grateful thank you! ) image190×190 35.7 KB",

I only 1.5 grace marks to pass this course. I didn’t knew the difficulty of this course because the rating of this course on discourse is wrong. So I took this subject but wasn’t able to give proper time to it. Somehow I managed to do the course but due to only 1.5 marks, I am not able to pass the course. I have only 4 course left, So if I pass this course I’ll be able to complete diploma by next term. Further sir, I do not fall under any fees relaxation policy, So sir I have to pay the same fees again for the same course. So it’s a huge request sir to grant me some grace marks to pass the course. If the difference was more I wouldn’t request at all. Even sir in the last term I repeated MLT because the difference was high and I couldn’t make it but I managed to pass it in this term. Sir I request you grant me some grace marks. My score is 38.6 so If you grant me 1 marks and round it off. then sir I’ll be able to pass it and will finish diploma by next term. Sir it is huge request sir. Please consider it as exception and sir this will be my last request because I respect your decision and will not make any further request. Thank you sir sincere regards",

I only 1.5 grace marks to pass this course. I didn’t knew the difficulty of this course because the rating of this course on discourse is wrong. So I took this subject but wasn’t able to give proper time to it. Somehow I managed to do the course but due to only 1.5 marks, I am not able to pass the course. I have only 4 course left, So if I pass this course I’ll be able to complete diploma by next term. Further sir, I do not fall under any fees relaxation policy, So sir I have to pay the same fees again for the same course. So it’s a huge request sir to grant me some grace marks to pass the course. If the difference was more I wouldn’t request at all. Even sir in the last term I repeated MLT because the difference was high and I couldn’t make it but I managed to pass it in this term. Sir I request you grant me some grace marks. My score is 38.6 so If you grant me 1 marks and round it off. then sir I’ll be able to pass it and will finish diploma by next term. Sir it is huge request sir. Please consider it as exception and sir this will be my last request because I respect your decision and will not make any further request. Thank you sir sincere regards",

          "content": "For TDS, you have to understand what the tools are and practise using them. Build little proof of concepts. Having a separate dev environment is usually a good idea incase you mess up the system. WSL (if you are using windows) is usually a good option to do that because many of the tools are primarily linux tools. This does not mean you cannot use another os. Just be prepared to face more challenges. MacOS typically is very similar to linux in the shell. Chief difference is usually not the commands but the installation method for software packages. Nearly any linux command and software package works the same in MacOS with some minor differences in only a very few cases. Windows is the worst of the bunch, because there are some tools that downright do not work on windows and the problems and instructions are usually completely different and including the commands for powershell. Be prepared for spending a lot more time if you are going windows only approach (without a linux vm or wsl). However if you are already comfortable with powershell and the cli quirks of windows then its fine. Bottom line: there are no shortcuts. Practise the concepts. Start early. All the study material is fully available on the site before the term starts (last term). But remeber that TDS changes each term so make sure to check the current term material as well.

We will not be creating any user frontends. For a developer, they will use these technologies to create front ends, validation etc. We leverage them for data extraction as data scientists. sqlite (or more broadly databases) again will be used purely from a data extraction perspective. We will not require you to learn how to create them or modify them. The goal in TDS is not to make you a developer, but rather to understand how to leverage technologies to source, extract, transform and deploy data in a useable form, which is very different from being a software developer. Granted there are significant overlaps when you learn these technologies and tools. Being good at TDS will inevitably mean you will be significantly well equipped to create end to end solutions. Learning html, css, javascript, sql will give you the capability to develop web sites etc, but we are never going to create one and so we will not spend time learning how to build one. Nice map!

More over, how to express doubts in almost every line (some times feeling shy too). As we (most of the students) are not ready to take up this course (with so many such stupid / doubts), it increases load on the instructors, TAs, and every teaching staff. From students side, this is causing lot of distress, as we struggle to raise so many doubts and get them clarified. By the team we read a line and try to understand what it means, we get another doubt. I strongly feel that “Diploma in Programming” (or set of subjects) must be made as a pre-requisite to this (TDS) course and any other such courses too. Alternatively, we have to create BRIDGE course sort of thing and make it a part of formal curriculum to reduce stress and distress in students and make teaching staff life better. I don’t know whom do I need to take this up, but request our TAs to carry our voice / message to the concerned authorities. Thanks, Prasad.",

If I am not mistaken, PIL operations (like img.convert(…)) are synchronous and blocking. from pathlib import Path from PIL import Image import io async def compress_image(input_path: Path, output_path: Path, quality: int = 85) -> None: \"\"\"Compress an image while maintaining reasonable quality.\"\"\" with Image.open(input_path) as img: # Convert RGBA to RGB if needed if img.mode == 'RGBA': img = img.convert('RGB') # Optimize for web img.save(output_path, 'WEBP', quality=quality, optimize=True) # Batch process images paths = Path('images').glob('*.jpg') for p in paths: await compress_image(p, p.with_suffix('.webp')) Removing async and await worked fine for me.

          "content": "I Kindly need Help with LLM CLI Tool – Model Authentication Issue with Models other OpenAI models. I’ve been trying to go a bit deeper into Module 1 after completing GA1, and I’ve encountered some issues while experimenting with the llm CLI tool and different models. Specifically, I tried running the following command to test the Gemini model, as shown on the Module 3 introduction page: llm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001 But I received the following error: Error: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'No auth credentials found', 'code': 401}} Initially, I had set my OpenAI key from AIPipe , but I got a “model not found” error. So I checked the available models using: llm model list At that point, the Gemini model wasn’t listed. I then installed the llm-openrouter plugin, and after that, the Gemini model appeared in the list. However, I’m now facing the above authentication error. To test if the issue was only with Gemini and other models other than OpenAI models , I created a personal API key from OpenRouter and tried running a free model:(i tried free models on both keys from AIpipe and my personal account since it doesn’t need any credits to be purchased) llm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/qwen/qwen3-8b:free This worked correctly with my OpenRouter API key, which confirms that the plugin is working fine. I’m confused about how to properly authenticate for other via AIPipe for OpenRouter using the llm CLI. I’ve been trying different approaches for the last two days but haven’t been able to resolve this. Certainly! Here’s a grammatically correct and polished version of the message you want to add at the end: I also tried setting the API keys individually for OpenAI, OpenRouter(this is basically configured while installing the plugin llm-openrouter), and even my personal keys, using the key management options mentioned in the llm documentation. Additionally, I saw that our course page suggest changing the base URL like this: export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1 llm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001 However, even this approach didn’t work for me. Could you kindly guide me on how to resolve this issue? Thank you for your time and help. Sincerely, Meikanda Sivam",

      "answer": "Your scores are evaluated on a site that is external to the seek portal and is not integrated with the seek portal. Therefore seek does not know if you have submitted or not and by default says that it has not been submitted because it cannot see your external evaluation. There will not be a fix for this for some time. Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal. The scores will only be visible in the dashboard. Just ignore anything inside seek portal. The dashboard is where all your subject score cards exists. As stated in multiple places on discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission. If your dashboard score does not match your final submission score on the assignment page, only then contact us regarding your marks. Kind regards",

Then you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=“21f3002647, post:1, topic:167471”] image250×534 3.92 KB [/quote] showing that your files are in the correct place.

      "question": "Dear @jkmadathil @Anand @Bharathi First and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TDS team in supporting us throughout this course. The live sessions and guidance have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience. However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations. Key Challenges Faced Lack of Prerequisites This course did not list any prerequisites, leading many students—including those from non-technical backgrounds—to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the course content, assignments, and projects have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage. Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure The difficulty of the projects has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to rely heavily on peer support just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully. Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback Many students joined TDS based on past Discourse posts and feedback, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for working professionals and students without prior experience. Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs) While we have put in significant effort—spending 2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs) to secure good scores—we still find ourselves struggling to meet expectations for the projects and RoE, which are significantly harder than anticipated. We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course. We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed. Thank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.",
      "answer": "Thank you @A_LAKSHMI for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response. Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the grading pattern will not be changed. And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP. TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words: This course is quite hard Here’s students’ feedback: It used to be an easy course until 2024. # # # Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # # Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # # LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # # The ROE is hard. # Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you’re ready for this course. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now. TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help Again to quote Anand: We encourage learning by sharing You CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam). Why should you copy? Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well. To learn well, understand what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize. To learn better, teach what you’ve learnt. Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself). Once again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable and internally make us more humble. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them. @22f2001640 Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.",

      "question": "@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj Dear TDS Team, I hope you are doing well. I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution. 1. Graded Assignments (GA) GA6 Doubts Unresolved: While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. (Thread link) GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. 2. Project Updates Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 2: There are multiple doubts posted in the Project 2 discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved? (thread link) 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. I appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response. Best regards, Lakshay",
      "answer": "lakshaygarg654: GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations. With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS. GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon. lakshaygarg654: Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing. Each and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway. lakshaygarg654: 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. You got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed. Kind regards",

So I took this subject but wasn’t able to give proper time to it. Somehow I managed to do the course but due to only 1.5 marks, I am not able to pass the course. I have only 4 course left, So if I pass this course I’ll be able to complete diploma by next term. Further sir, I do not fall under any fees relaxation policy, So sir I have to pay the same fees again for the same course. So it’s a huge request sir to grant me some grace marks to pass the course. If the difference was more I wouldn’t request at all. Even sir in the last term I repeated MLT because the difference was high and I couldn’t make it but I managed to pass it in this term. Sir I request you grant me some grace marks. My score is 38.6 so If you grant me 1 marks and round it off. then sir I’ll be able to pass it and will finish diploma by next term. Sir it is huge request sir. Please consider it as exception and sir this will be my last request because I respect your decision and will not make any further request. Thank you sir sincere regards",
