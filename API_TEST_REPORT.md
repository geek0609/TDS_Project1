## 🧪 YAML Questions Test Results

All 4 YAML questions **FAILED** with identical generic responses:

### Test 1: GA5 GPT Model Clarification ❌
- **Question:** "The question asks to use gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 model but the ai-proxy provided by Anand sir only supports gpt-4o-mini. So should we just use gpt-4o-mini or use the OpenAI API for gpt3.5 turbo?"
- **Expected:** Clarification about gpt-3.5-turbo-0125
- **Expected Link:** https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939
- **Actual:** Generic error message
- **Search Results:** 0

### Test 2: GA4 Bonus Scoring ❌
- **Question:** "If a student scores 10/10 on GA4 as well as a bonus, how would it appear on the dashboard?"
- **Expected:** Mention of "110" 
- **Expected Link:** https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga4-data-sourcing-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/165959
- **Actual:** Generic error message
- **Search Results:** 0

### Test 3: Docker vs Podman ❌
- **Question:** "I know Docker but have not used Podman before. Should I use Docker for this course?"
- **Expected:** Recommendation about Podman
- **Expected Link:** https://tds.s-anand.net/#/docker
- **Actual:** Generic error message
- **Search Results:** 0

### Test 4: Future Exam Date ❌
- **Question:** "When is the TDS Sep 2025 end-term exam?"
- **Expected:** "doesn't know" response
- **Actual:** Generic error message (though this is actually correct behavior)
- **Search Results:** 0

## 🔍 Search Endpoint Analysis

Direct testing of the `/api/search` endpoint shows:
- All search queries return **zero results**
- Tested queries: "Docker", "Podman", "GA4", "gpt-3.5-turbo", "bonus scoring"
- API responds correctly but finds no matches

## 🐛 Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be in the **semantic search functionality**:

1. **Knowledge base is loaded** ✅
2. **Embeddings are reported as ready** ✅  
3. **Gemini API connections work** ✅
4. **Semantic search returns no results** ❌

### Potential Causes:
1. **Gemini API Key Issues:** The deployment might not have access to the correct Gemini API key
2. **Embedding Generation Problems:** Embeddings might not be properly generated during deployment
3. **Search Algorithm Issues:** The cosine similarity search might be failing
4. **Environment Configuration:** Missing environment variables or configuration issues

## 📈 Performance Metrics

- **Average Response Time:** 0.95 seconds
- **API Availability:** 100%
- **Error Rate:** 100% (for actual questions)
- **Generic Responses:** 100%

## 🎯 Expected vs Actual Behavior

| Test Case | Expected Behavior | Actual Behavior | Status |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|---------|
| Health Check | API responds with status | ✅ Working | ✅ PASS |
| Knowledge Base | Data loaded | ✅ 533 items loaded | ✅ PASS |
| Semantic Search | Find relevant content | ❌ 0 results always | ❌ FAIL |
| Question Answering | Generate contextual answers | ❌ Generic error only | ❌ FAIL |
| Link Generation | Return relevant links | ❌ No links returned | ❌ FAIL |

## 🔧 Recommended Actions

1. **Check Gemini API Key Configuration** in the deployment environment
2. **Verify Embedding Generation** process during deployment
3. **Debug Search Algorithm** with logging
4. **Test Local vs Deployed** behavior comparison
5. **Monitor Gemini API Quotas** and rate limits

## 📊 YAML Compatibility Score

**Overall Score: 0/4 (0%)**

- GA5 Model Question: ❌ FAIL
- GA4 Scoring Question: ❌ FAIL  
- Docker/Podman Question: ❌ FAIL
- Future Exam Question: ❌ FAIL

## 💡 Conclusion

The TDS Virtual TA is successfully deployed with all infrastructure components working correctly. However, the core AI functionality (semantic search and answer generation) is not working, likely due to an issue with the Gemini API integration or embedding generation process in the deployment environment.

The API architecture is sound, and once the semantic search issue is resolved, the system should work as expected per the YAML test specifications.
