Yes you dont have to submit your assignments but just give the End term.

In that case 209 would get replaced by 310 Hello Sir, When I am following that logic to rename files, assessment check is giving error “Incorrect. Try again.” @21f2000370 Since you have managed to get all the answers correct, I presume there are no further issues w/ Q16. Hi, I am unable to access Graded Assignment 1.

Disable/remove Ad blocker Disable/remove Tracking blocker (Allow third party cookies) Use Chrome browser Disable Browser extensions As I highlighted earlier, Its not accepting the answer if I follow correct logic for renaming for example 209->210, but it is accepting if rename as 209->310 Hi Anant, 21f2000370: image1296×158 7.29 KB Here in question, it’s mentioned to replace every digit with next digit, that’s why 209 would be 310. In attempting the third question, I’m unable to download the npm package as it requires docker. When trying to install docker from the installer, it freezes in the verifying package stage. Can somebody please help solve my problem? @carlton @Jivraj image1627×202 12.6 KB Which HTML content we want to take? Hi Suhani, npm does not require docker. Kind regards Hi Hisham, Its described in the question. There is a hidden element hiding somewhere after that question. You would have to inspect the DOM to find it. Screenshot 2025-01-11 at 10.29.41 PM1440×900 160 KB @s.anand please guide me through this question, my answer is showing incorrect Hello Sir. I am unable to install uv in my windows system. Whenever I run the code provided at the reference link in Powershell, my anti-virus system sends a message that it was blocked. Even after blocking Real-time security, uv does not display. What am I doing wrong? Hi, I’m unable to view assignments. below is the screenshot for your reference. Screenshot 2025-01-12 150511963×632 14.5 KB Please suggest me a way to view it. I have allowed third-party cookies as well. Thanks Hi manmeet, I don’t know about solution to this. Some network setting might be causing problem. Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains. I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection. Hi samra, Try installing some other browser see if that works. Hi mishkat, Without sharing code, can you pls share your approach how you are trying to solve this question. Ok, thanks. I turned off many security features including anti-virus system’s security and windows security options etc. Then it allowed me to download uv on the system. Now it is running, and I got output as json for Q2. 2 days ago I attempted TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development Tools and scored 8.5. I didn’t submit as I wanted to attempt incorrect answer questions. When I logged in today it says score is 0. Shall I submit or not? Do I have to attempt all questions again? Why the assignment and submissions are two separate pages/links? If [seek] (Nptel Seekh) can access [TDS exam] (Technical Assessment) then why we need to submit from seek? The seek portal question is to confirm that the student has seen the GA. It does not actually give you a score. Otherwise students sometimes claim that they looked and did not find any GAs (this has happened in the past). Hence the two stage verification. You still need to the submissions to get a score for the GA. The actual GA questions are on https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ via the seek portal or on the Tools in Data Science introduction page. Its just a more robust way of ensuring that students have indeed viewed the GAs. As far your submission goes, we have your last submission and the score. We will check on our end why your submission has not reloaded into your browser. Normally these are stored in session storage. So if your browser has deleted them, it might have not loaded from our back end server. @s.anand will be able to confirm the reason for this problem. For the time being if you are making a fresh submission, just fill in all the answers in again, so that your latest submission will be marked correctly. Kind regards Thanks @carlton. I answered questions on https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ but didn’t click on the button “Submit Answers” on seek as my answers for 2 questions were incorrect. My question is whether I need to submit on seek to save answers on Exam? (I checked my score and saved it on the exam site.) Hi @Nelson Your answers on the exam site that have been submitted will be saved and used as the basis for your score. Saying yes/no on seek does not materially impact scoring. Its just an awareness question. Even if you answered yes on the seek portal, you can still revise your answers on the exam site. The final submission is always whats locked in for the score (until the deadline passes). Kind regards It might be because you are not adding up the correct tags with attribute data-value. There may be other tags within the same DOM and having the attribute data-value. Kind regards I am stuck with the last question. SQLite question. It gives the error: Error: Got [[121510.39]]... Is it possible to have a more descriptive error? It’s a simple SQL query. I tried various options in my query. I didn’t succeed. Hi Nelson, I checked your set of questions, you are using wrong query to get answer. kind regards @carlton @Jivraj In this picture for the given question i have tried in python and chatgpt both are giving same answer still showing wrong. GA1 question Neutral Minimal Photo Collage Mood Board Instagram Story1080×1920 119 KB @Jivraj @carlton The same issue is happening in the question 12 of GA1.

Minimal Square Photo Collage Photography Instagram Post1080×1080 126 KB Hi Shouvik, Your code seems correct to me. I think there is an extra space before your answer in input box.

Apologies, I may not know full context of the question, as I haven’t attempted GA1 fully yet I had this same doubt, I tried by adding the “span” tag’s value too it showed correct for me. I’d suggest you to try that. Oh, good catch, @23f2000237 and @siva.bhaskaran - I made a mistake in the evaluation script. It included the span. I fixed it. Note: None of the earlier answers are affected, i.e. if you got it right earlier, it’ll stay right. It’s hackable. It’s possible to get the answer to some questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That’s allowed. What does exactly mean, if someone could elaborate without giving it away, please? @carlton I have tried but still am unable to do only that question if someone can help me with the code because everytime im getting a different answer its my last question @21f2000370 i hope you wouldve completed it Use Git bash the problem will be resolved Hi Daksh, Did you solve it or still facing some issues with it ?

Sha256sum is not recognized as an internal or external command how to solve this plzz answer @carlton If you are on windows, you might not be able to use sha256sum. Here are two disussions that might help you out. Discussion 1 Discussion 2 @Rohitkumar7463 @23f2003845 If you are on Windows Powershell Then instead of sha256sum you can simply use Get-FileHash Send the output of the npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md to a text file eg. output.txt and then use Get-FileHash on powershell with the output.txt and it will use sha256 by default and give you the exact same output. You might be able to pipe the data directly to Get-FileHash but I have not tried direct piping. The above method works guaranteed. Kind regards @s.anand Sir as you said in the previous post, the evaluation script is also updated based on errors other students point out. I am submitting my answers as soon as the GA is released and stopping once I get 10/10. Will you reevaluate the answers once the deadline is over? Or the marks I see right now will be set in stone? If you will, then it will be based on the updated evaluation script which can reduce my marks. image742×336 21.3 KB @iamsarthak – as long as you don’t save again, your score will stay 10, even if I modify the evaluation script We don’t re-evaluate previous results in the graded assignments. @s.anand sir, Question 15 is under the section for linux I got the file which needs to be processed to answer the question image583×167 4.09 KB I can solve this now using pandas.

But since you already know how to do it with pandas, I suggest you explore how to do it with something like awk (or any other tool) to get a broader exposure into different approaches. 20250120_2039501920×1440 168 KB Sir is it right of sha sum question to pass the graded 1 how much points are required for 10 ? use chatgpt for the solution(sum(take(sortby))), it will give you the wrong answer but explain the concepts, use that go to colab and code one solution(will take abt 2 mins) I used https://www.microsoft365.com/launch/excel?auth=1 @Rohitkumar7463 The hash code is exactly what you see under the column Hash, 7E…E5 Thats the Hash code for the file output.txt A Hash is a nearly unique representation of some data within some range dependent on the type of hashing algorithm and the amount of unique pieces of data that need to be encoded.

Depending upon what software you use it might change modification date while unzipping. use unzip command line tool or winrar extractor, these are 2 tools we have tested. kind regards Hi Saravanan, I noticed an issue with your submission. In the question, there is a name Bob, but it doesn’t appear in your answer after applying the required sorting. Since the data for each student is dynamically generated and unique, the answer you submitted seems inconsistent with your dataset. We encourage collaboration among students, but copying answers is not acceptable. Instead, I suggest reaching out to your friend to understand the script they used, run it on your dataset, and ensure you fully grasp the solution. kind regards Thanks lot jivraj. i updated my script and answers too Thanks Screenshot 2025-01-24 1842222677×1066 294 KB In the question 10 what should be the correct format for jason data as I edited the data according to given conditions but in Hash I am facing problem again and again Also, in Q11 What is meaning of element below given in the question \" Let’s make sure you know how to select elements using CSS selectors.

It should be {key1: value1, key2: value2}. Also make sure you enclose the keys and values in double-quotes, and after every key-value pair put a comma. i am doing so only … i can send u the example - { “0”: “wEfsmtde”, “83”: “NghqzO3DL”, “NqN7EcM”: “I”, “vFD2C”: “KAB”} i am not able to find what’s the mistake Your format seems to be correct, but cause you are still facing that problem then these are the few reasons I can think of Check the entire JSON object and make sure that each and every element follows this format. Use Chrome for getting that hash code, it could be the case that some other browser may not be pasting the object as intended. Okay, i will go through my json object once. And for hash code i am using chrome only It worked.

This issue is because when you deploy on github pages it encrypts any email that’s on page. kind regards. I am facing an issue with Docker Desktop. Docker Desktop Error558×377 27 KB I have uninstalled and installed Docker (run as administrator). wsl --version WSL version: 2.3.26.0 Kernel version: 5.15.167.4-1 WSLg version: 1.0.65 MSRDC version: 1.2.5620 Direct3D version: 1.611.1-81528511 DXCore version: 10.0.26100.1-240331-1435.ge-release Windows version: 10.0.19045.5011 Tried many solutions after googling for the issue. So far no solution. Anyone else faced this issue and found a solution? Hi Telvin, Try opening localhost:8080 in browser if that works, if it opens in browser then issue might be with some network configurations. I solved this question in github codespace, which didn’t require me to make any changes in network. kind regards kind regards @Nelson I would recommend Podman or Docker CE rather than Docker Desktop. Docker Desktop is not free for organizations over 250 people and many organizations have therefore moved away from it. @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj I tired , in browser localhost:8080 is working fine but ngrok is not working. Is there any other tools for tunneling that can be used. @22f2001640 in that case a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080 Please try one of these: Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network GitHub codespaces, as @Jivraj suggested You could try an ngrok alternative like localtunnel but I don’t think that’ll work. Thank you, Sir! What is the Docker image URL? It should look like: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/$USER/$REPO/general If I use Podman, will the answer be correct assuming I have done all steps correctly?

So simply changing class_ to class is not going to work. The only thing you need to change is the keyword accepted by the api not the variable name used inside your function. Hope that helps you narrow down the problem. Kind regards Hi Team , For GA - 2 , Question 6: I am done with the code, deployed same on vercel. And It is working fine gives correct json response as expected in browser. But When I try to that on portal It gives me “CORS Missing Allow Origin” Error. Screenshot 2025-01-16 at 6.58.43 PM3570×1344 436 KB I have added “Access-Control-Allow-Origin” as “*” for allowing request from any origin. I get the correct response in browser but it fails in quiz portal. Can anyone please suggest what exactly I am missing here. Thanks Kushagra image1747×186 10.6 KB Hello, this is working when I put in parameters, but not when I submit on quiz portal. What to do? Hi @carlton @Jivraj , Can you please help on this one. Hi Kushagra, can you share vercel url so that I can test. Kind regards Hi Aindree, I tried to send a request to your application https://your-app2.vercel.app/api with url encoded parameter class=7Q. It should fetch marks of that particular class. But in response it sends {\"marks\": []}. Check if your csv file is correct. Also check if code is correct. Kind regards Jivraj For the questions such as cors, llm i have to locally run the code and submit it.After a while if i have to submit it again the prev url that i have submitted is throwing an error. Maybe becaue it is checking the url again at the time of submission. Fix this issue, the similar issue lies with the image compression problem. when i upload the code and checks and submits it at that time i got the marks but after sometime if i make the change in some other question the file that i uploaded prev is nowhere to found.so please fix this issue @s.anand Hi Tushar, For questions which require submitting a url, when you click on save button all those server’s should be running. For that image uploading question one solution would be to keep image in a particular directory, and then upload from there every time you make a submission. Kind regards Jivraj https://your-app2.vercel.app/api?name=gy5&name=nk&name=ySOPVNRtt is the one I tried. Somehow it worked correctly at my end. I’ll recheck though. Thanks Hi Jivraj, I tried with another public url, It is working for me now. Thanks Kushagra Hi, I have downloaded the Llamafile as instructed. But I can’t run it on my mac. It says command not found. Pls let me know what I should do. For the Q.2 on image compression, for PNG, SVG or WEBP files, I’m getting the error “Could not process image. Is it browser supported image? Image pixels do not match the original” (I believe the last part is not applicable as the image was not processed ). Visually, I could not find any difference between the two files and the size of new file is less than 1,500 bytes. Tried through Chrome v132.0.6834.83 without any add-ons/extensions. image830×156 10.3 KB this mainly happens when ngrok able to tunnel to given port but nothing is running on that port,so check that first i am getting this error image1636×415 30 KB i have tried to submit it will a query as well but than also it is giving me the same error.But for me it is giving me the correct output. image1065×178 7.32 KB @Jivraj @carlton Hi Tushar, Make sure cors are enabled, if so can you share screenshot of console tab in browser? kind regards Jivraj { \"version\": 2, \"builds\": [ { \"src\": \"app.py\", \"use\": \"@vercel/python\" } ], \"routes\": [ { \"src\": \"/api\", \"dest\": \"app.py\" } ], \"headers\": [ { \"source\": \"/api/(.*)\", \"headers\": [ { \"key\": \"Access-Control-Allow-Credentials\", \"value\": \"true\" }, { \"key\": \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"value\": \"*\" }, { \"key\": \"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\", \"value\": \"GET,OPTIONS,PATCH,DELETE,POST,PUT\" }, { \"key\": \"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\", \"value\": \"X-CSRF-Token, X-Requested-With, Accept, Accept-Version, Content-Length, Content-MD5, Content-Type, Date, X-Api-Version\" } ] } ] } @Jivraj @carlton i have added the header key in order to use the cors as said in the vercel doc but still i am getting that error. what to do? i have added the cors in the app.py file as well from flask import Flask, request, jsonify import json from flask_cors import CORS app = Flask(__name__) CORS(app) # Load the data with open(\"q-vercel-python.json\", \"r\") as f: data = json.load(f) @app.route(\"/api\", methods=[\"GET\"]) def get_marks(): names = request.args.getlist(\"name\") marks = [student[\"marks\"] for student in data if student[\"name\"] in names] return jsonify({\"marks\": marks}) if __name__ == \"__main__\": app.run() https://student-marks-4vsd75x3f-tushars-projects-f2a54030.vercel.app/api @23f2003751 While I understand why you might choose to use flask due to your familiarity with it, the http.server library is just very simple to use. The only extra line of code you would need inside your get request if you used the http.server library would be: self.send_header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\") Try to rewrite your code using http.server library so that your debugging for simple tasks like this is easy. The boilerplate code for a get request using the http.server library was already given in Q6. So you have to do very minimal modifications to it and it works like a charm. Kind regards In GA-2 Q6, Q9 and Q10 answers are not getting accepted on my device(Mac book air) but when I am executing the same thing from my friends device(windows 11 pro) it is getting accepted and then when I try to save it from her device and then do the final submission from my my device then again the answers are not getting submitted for the same three questions. @s.anand Sir please help me through this @23F300327 You would have to be a bit more specific on what exactly is the nature of your error on your machine. GA2 - Q6 has no dependency on the OS or your computer. It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems. Now typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly. Also the live sessions on youtube will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing. There will be session 2025-01-20T14:30:00Z→2025-01-20T16:30:00Z which will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries.

You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code. When a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api with parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request. The rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program. That’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this # api/index.py import json from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler): def do_GET(self): self.send_response(200) self.send_header('Content-type','application/json') self.send_header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\") self.end_headers() self.wfile.write(json.dumps({\"message\": \"Hello!\"}).encode('utf-8')) return Notice there is no if __name__ == \"__main__\": code block. This would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application. if __name__ == \"__main__\": is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application. Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default handler class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared. Another possible problem: By default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \\u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues TDS > Development Tools > unicode So converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it. Let us know what worked. We are all learning from each other.

[UPDATE 22/02/2025]: GA 2 NEW DEADLINE: 2025-02-02T18:29:00Z I’m not sure of the exact reason for the issue, but there are different ways to deploy to Vercel. One approach is using a vercel.json configuration file, and another is adding headers directly in the API code. You can follow Gui Bibeau’s guide to add CORS headers to your deployment setup. Also check the recording from yesterday’s session for more clarity in that session Carlton deployed application directly from github repository. If you’re still facing issues, you can join today’s session at 9 PM. For deploying a Flask or FastAPI app to Vercel, refer to this guide on DEV Community. I’ve tried both methods, and they work well.

Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat. That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”. Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials! So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done. In the meanwhile: There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything. Kind regards thank you. you have no idea how much this helps sir Once i close my local llm and close the nrgrok URL (after entering the answer and the answer being correct), the next time I refresh or check the answer in the Ga2 site, q10 gets marked wrong. I have to redo the entire process for it to be correct again. Can you clarify why this is happening? because it dynamically checks the answer each time a submit is done and if the ngrok tunnel and the service is not running at the time, then it marks it wrong. Since every student’s answer is going to be unique (unlike a mathematics question), by necessity we have to dynamically check the answer each submit. The workaround to prevent having to do it all over again, is to simply check all your answers that do not need active running servers first, then before doing a final save, run the servers for the required questions and the ngrok tunnel and submit to get the full marks. Just dont forget that your last save is what gets graded. Just ignore for now once you got it working. Solve all the other ones first and then for the final submission “get all your ducks in a row.” Kind regards hi @23f2003853 I think you are running your application server inside a virtual machine because of which it doesn’t have visibility to outside world(request coming from other domains). So you would need to identify ipaddress of your virtual machine and would need to use that in place of 127.0.0.1. Take help from GPT to identify ipaddress of virtual machine. Hello Sir, I’ve been working on question 6 and I’m facing this error where the marks are not ordered properly.

Also join tomorrow’s session towards ending of each session we use to take doubts. @23F3002987_J_SRI_BAL , This must be a production deployment url, that’s why I am not able to access it. image1822×874 43.7 KB Solution : Go to vercel dashboard and select your project, and below domains you would find a url use that. image1709×787 66.9 KB If this doesn’t solve problem, pls join tomorrow’s session between 8-10 towards ending of session we use to take doubts. Kind regards Jivraj daksh76: I have laready tried doing that as well but it still doesnt seem to work Hi @daksh76, Can you mention exact error or problem that you are facing. The issue might be with the IP address you’re using. Try using 127.0.0.1 and check if it’s the correct localhost IP for your machine. Also, test with http://localhost:8000/api to see if it works. If that doesn’t solve the problem and you’re running port 8000 inside a virtual machine, use the ipconfig command to check the correct IP address. We usually address doubts at the end of every session. Our next session is on the 31st—you can join then and ask your question if none of above solutions works. image1903×657 83.4 KB image1914×751 82.1 KB @Jivraj , Thankyou for the quick response. I have attached both console and network screenshots. Hope these are the ones you were referring to. Sure, I will join tonight’s session and try to rectify the issue. Meanwhile will update here if i was able to resolve it. If I entered the URL I get the error Failed to fetch image602×182 25.2 KB If I run the same in my browser, I get the output (just I tried for two name available in json file) image602×102 14.9 KB Kindly help me to fix the issue image1559×334 19.5 KB This url shows correct but after few hour it shows this error @carlton pls help me to fix this you need to keep the services running. Else it will fail. Do whats required, regenerate that link and paste it once you complete and save it. this way you can avoid rework. sir the output im getting after correcting the code is showing incorrect on the portal if you could suggest me why is that happening, where am i making an error because i have cross checked this a lot of times and still am unable to understand where i might be making a mistake I had faced the same issue. Please ensure the url is not protected against the access of third party (IITM will access your url. To check it, try to open the url in different browser) Hi sakshi in vercel problem i also had similar error. remove this code if name == ‘main’: 24 # app.run(debug=True) frm your flask app then run it. it worked for me i found this with the help of chatgpt. vercel has some built in features to run so this is not required it seems. I was facing problem that how to make a class as variable name for Q9 in GA2 . but now i get a solution which was helpful for making class as variable. The below command is the solution for the problem of how to make a class variable name in python. 17383569374811920×1200 92.1 KB the async def root() this command line in image is solution for our problem. Hi Srividya, Thats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints. When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs. This renders name == main part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it). In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You do not create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2. This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications. Thanks for your input. Kind regards @carlton @Jivraj sir pls help me to fix this issue Questions 9 and 10 require running a development server from my side. Right now, the questions are marked correct and I’ve saved the assignment. Since the servers won’t always be running, I hope this won’t cause a problem during evaluation. What am i missing here? i am also facing same issue, question 9 . attached screenshots.

Hi @23f2003853 , did you enable cors ? If yes then pls send screenshot of console and network tab. Kind regards So if I kept the server running and saved the answer, but after reloading it’s showing incorrect We can’t just keep it running. Hi @daksh76 , I didn’t actually used python to solve this particular question. I tried for some time but it was not working. So I just used Squoosh, for now pls use this. whenever you want to submit your answers by pressing save button at that time only all servers should must be running. I did that, while running all the severs i saved my answers and it showed “correct”. But after sometime when I re-loaded my answers it showed incorrect. Hi @24ds1000082_Vivek, @23f3004114 , You guys are not using correct format for response. { \"students\": [ { \"studentId\": 1, \"class\": \"1A\" }, { \"studentId\": 2, \"class\": \"1B\" }, ... ] } This is correct for which have a object with key students which is not present in your response. kind regards That’s okay, when you click on save answers button just make sure all servers are running. Yes Hari, most probably that’s what the problem is. @23F3002987_J_SRI_BAL Check if cors are enabled. Kind regards @ carlton @ Jivraj Gentlemen! In GA2 answers, I have a problem. Question 10, the ngrok tunnel url was once correct and I saved it . When I revisited the GA2 again, the question 10 was marked incorrect. Do I need to do anything else ? Secondly the image comression file needs to be reloaded everytime I reconnect to the GA2. When I reload the last saved version, it does not take into the answer already saved. Third, the url link as given on publishing the page via github is obviously correct. But on checking, even after ?v = 1 …it does not work. Could you kindly look into them and advise if anything else needs to be done at my end? thanks & regards. Week-2 Question-8, I am getting error image1730×387 32.5 KB I have pushed my image in the repository, pulled it and ran once, it worked This is how my docker hub repository looks, image2239×1129 278 KB https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/23f2000573/first-rep/general Yes sir. I did keep them active when saving the assignment and the answers were saved successfully(The score was 10/10). I was talking about evaluation after deadline. In the ngrok question I was getting that same json error as everybody else since last 7 days or so. The ngrok link was working fine in browser every time but. Today i ran the LLama file with --n-gpu-layers 35 parameter at the end which makes it run using my laptops graphics card i guess. After i ran LLama file using this and ngrok later, my link was accepted in the GA 2 and i did not get any error after that. @carlton @Jivraj did this happen because i ran LLama file using my laptop GPU? This was suggested to me by another student who had the same problem. image717×212 8.67 KB here it is giving output but when i run on question page it gives error. image837×232 10.8 KB please look into this @Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini https://new-deploy12345.vercel.app/api?name=Mn&name=m Try these @21f3000745 Download the data file once again and replace it with your current file, then deploy. If this doesn’t work, then: Try clicking on Check button once again. There are few cases where due to duplicity or other problems in the data, this bug occurs. The next check will most probably work. Reload the page, open the Networks Tab in the Inspect menu, click on Fetch/XHR filter button. Next click on check, if this error prompts up, you will get the request the system sent to check your answer. Copy that request and check on localhost. yeah it worked. thankyou @Saransh_Saini actually on every reload of page , it generates new data which makes question so tedious. So the problem was with the JSON data or you just clicked again on check and it worked? i loaded the data again as you said and clicked on check again. then it gave correct Hi @24DS1000121_ULAGAOOZ , For the ngrok tunnel question and any other question requiring a server URL, make sure to keep all servers running when clicking the Save button. Also, I couldn’t find the GitHub Pages URL in your GA2 response, and many answers are unmarked. It seems you didn’t click the Save button. Your current score is 4.5/10.

Gentleman, I dont understand. I just now, on triggering the Github action, I copied the url of my github repository. It worked ! The problem is that, if class param is passed, only then it is filtering as usual, but when no param is passed it returns the entire DataFrame, which is not supposed to happen. If no parameter is passed it should return an empty list. I suspect you directly copied this code from ChatGPT without understanding, which is acceptable for us, but not very helpful for you.

It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems. Now typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly. Also the live sessions on youtube will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing. There will be session 2025-01-20T14:30:00Z→2025-01-20T16:30:00Z which will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries.

          "content": "@23F300327 Typically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code. When a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api with parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request. The rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program. That’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this # api/index.py import json from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler): def do_GET(self): self.send_response(200) self.send_header('Content-type','application/json') self.send_header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\") self.end_headers() self.wfile.write(json.dumps({\"message\": \"Hello!\"}).encode('utf-8')) return Notice there is no if __name__ == \"__main__\": code block. This would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application. if __name__ == \"__main__\": is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application. Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default handler class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared. Another possible problem: By default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \\u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues TDS > Development Tools > unicode So converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it. Let us know what worked. We are all learning from each other. Kind regards",

Also check the recording from yesterday’s session for more clarity in that session Carlton deployed application directly from github repository. If you’re still facing issues, you can join today’s session at 9 PM. For deploying a Flask or FastAPI app to Vercel, refer to this guide on DEV Community.

There is more than one way to skin a cat. That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”. Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials! So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done. In the meanwhile: There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything. Kind regards",

The workaround to prevent having to do it all over again, is to simply check all your answers that do not need active running servers first, then before doing a final save, run the servers for the required questions and the ngrok tunnel and submit to get the full marks. Just dont forget that your last save is what gets graded. Just ignore for now once you got it working.

When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs. This renders name == main part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it). In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You do not create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2. This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications. Thanks for your input. Kind regards",

Could this issue also be caused by accessing the assignment from multiple devices? Hi Shalini, We are aware of the issue and @s.anand is working on a solution. The temporary fix is to just reenter all the answers before hitting the Save button. Thanks for the reminder, please bear with the inconvenience while its being fixed. The last submission is always saved. So please make sure that your last submission contains all the answers for all the questions. Kind regards Hello, I am also facing the same issue. In my last submission the score was 7.25. Right now it is showing 0. The problem is i had few questions remaining to solve and i dont know which ones now. All of them r showing empty in the solution box. Also i didnt write my answers someplace else, so i would have to solve all the questions again? And also if i just for example for testing submit solution of 1 question now then my score would get reduced from 7.25 to the marks of that 1 question i submitted right? Saved multiple times on the graded website as well submitted yes on the course tab but the score keeps resetting to 0 with no progress saved @24f2006531 @GaURaVinDeX @shubham6 Please check this fix. It may solve your problem. GA1 - Development Tools - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025] Tools in Data Science @23f2005067 @23f2003751 I added a “Recent saves” feature. This will show the time and score for the last 3 times you saved. You can load from any of these. [image] Do remember to click the “Check” button to calculate your score. That is not automatic. Please check this out and let me know if there are any bugs. Thanks. Much appreciated sir",

Kind regards Jivraj Will those session be on youtube too? Hi Sakthivel, Yes all sessions are being recorded and are available on youtube within a day. Jan 25 TDS Playlist Kind regards Screenshot 2025-01-23 1516141281×125 18.1 KB sir @Jivraj after editing line 127 in datagen.py i got those required data files. is it allowed ? also i had to run datagen.py MANUALLY(is this process also should be automatic)? Hi Guddu , I didn’t make any changes to file and it worked for me. Can you mention what is need of making changes ? command that I used : uv run datagen.py 22f3002542@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --root ./data here --root option defines the folder where you want to store generated data. by default it would try to create a folder in root directory of operating system. Kind regards Jivraj getting this issue : openai.AuthenticationError: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}} Hi Aishik, Pls add context to your query, without that we won’t be able to understand, where exactly you are facing problem. 23f2005325: openai.AuthenticationError: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}} Possible reasons for this issue: Not using anand sir’s proxy url for sending requests. Token not being correct. yes I was not setting the base url to the proxy. I have fixed it thank you . While implementing task A5, I am confused about what recent actually means in the phrase “recent log file”, mentioned under task A5, in the problem statement. This confusion arises because there are no dates corresponding to the log files. Should I consider log-0 as the most recent one? or the log-<largest_number> file? Please clarify.

As in some of the GA1, the linux answers only accepted. Please tell me that, do we can do it in the desktop or we have to use linux? @Jivraj @carlton The bash commands are usually run in a linux machine, but you can easily run those commands in VSCode without installing any virtual machines. Download the WSL extension in VSCode and you will get a WSL terminal to work with. For more information watch this video https://youtu.be/q74CP4fB7cY?si=M_zw8WzpmMCyVQat or watch TDS Live Sessions. Regards, TDS TA what frameworks can we use? hopefully anything? or what frameworks can’t we use? @carlton @Jivraj Project 1 deliverables are all that matter. How you accomplish them is not very relevant. The keys to a successful Project 1 are: Deliverables, and an example of the Evaluation has been provided. If your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered. Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am1764×1764 374 KB Please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom. So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test. Kind regards @23f1002382 You can use any library as long as your Project 1 meets the deliverable requirements and does all the (20+) API tasks. Kind regards A sample evaluation script for Project 1 tasks A1-A10 is available at tools-in-data-science-public/project-1 at tds-2025-01-project-1-wip · sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public · GitHub You can use this to validate your code for Project 1.

By clicking the project link ,I am getting the notes…but no project is available in my project 1 by clicking the link image1198×136 9.49 KB image1750×581 70.9 KB I am getting this opened. Hi @Divya1 , There won’t be any project1 page such as GA1s, there is a google form(which can be found in same page) which needs to be filled after you do project1. Hi @23f2005325 , Extracting details from credit cards is sensitive, try using strong prompts or take code from LLM and execute it in script. kind regards Regarding Wednenday 9-10 pm live session, maybe the instructors could also discuss how to use docker as a virtual environment using maybe ollama(local llm as now there is deepseek opensource, i doubt we would need to use openai for testing, just for production(test submission) would be enough) and also some agent(langchain, autogen, crewai) just a quick how-to on setting up and problems while setting up if possible More resources on docker. Using docker as a virtual environment. Editing and executing code in Dockerfiles (like when you change code in src a web framework automatically reloads page(hot reload)), something along the lines of this . @carlton @Jivraj 23f1002382: Regarding Wednenday 9-10 pm live session, maybe the instructors could also discuss how to use docker as a virtual environmen In Tuesday’s(21 January) session we had discussed docker towards ending of session. What was discussed in that live session regarding docker: Search for existing containers on repositories such as dockerhub. Pull an existing docker image. Run that image inside a container. Enter to that container and modify something(such as installing python inside a ubuntu container, for customization or create some file) Once done you can commit it. And push customized container’s image to docker hub. Regarding local models running for project1, it’s a good idea, we will see if it’s possible to discuss in session. In the google forms , I have 2 questions in one form now to submit should it is compulsory that to answer the both the questions? Hi @Divya1 Screenshot 2025-01-29 at 8.19.05 am1738×982 122 KB Please do very carefully all things mentioned in the Deliverables as well as look at the Evaluation Section. Screenshot 2025-01-29 at 8.26.08 am1460×496 45.5 KB We had a session on 28th Jan introducing all the important aspects of Project. If you do not do everything exactly as mentioned especially the pre - requisites mentioned in the Evaluation section you will get 0 in the project and there will be no appeal for failing to meet the pre - requisites of the evaluation criteria. In order for us to evaluate the project you have to provide the deliverables mentioned above.

Although you are returning a 200 ok, the get request file must match the expectation. In other words after running the first task for example, has the new format.md been formatted correctly and matches the expected output. In this case you would write out the the expected variable in the evaluate.py and see if result variable matches the expected. Then you can figure out what went wrong. Kind regards Ok sir But please try to take those sessions sooner Because it’s taking too much time for me to do any problem(plus two more courses and one oppe you know) .so I just want to build the project before deadline. Please give the date, time and agenda also please. Yes sir , As soon as we know we will send an announcement. Kind regards. the model keeps wrong answer, it says uvicorn for uv and has no info on how to run uv even after explicitly giving instructions(basically an older model) , basic “ls” command is also wrong, among other things. You can check your logs with respect to my api key. Do you think we could access a better model? Maybe Download Deepseek 70b or even 671b and create an api while y’all run the model locally, in the long it would be cheaper for the course? because the model doesn’t know basic commands after telling how to do it. So if the model gives us wrong commands 2/3 times then how would we even solve the question. I spent a week on this just saying @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj sent pull request maybe accept it then please can we have the code for this session please? @Jivraj @carlton i need some help can you send me your repo? Hello, I recently started working on the project. I understood how to do all the phase A tasks on a high level but I’m struggling to start the implementation of the first task in phase A. I’m confused mainly about how the /data directory is supposed to be created, I don’t know how to generate the data and a little confused about the output formats. I would appreciate if I could get in contact with anyone who could guide me in the right direction. Hello everyone, @s.anand @carlton I had a few queries regarding the project; I am preloading my docker image with uv and generating the /data files when the container is ran. For task A1, I am automating my server to remove the /data directory that’s already present and run datagen.py again. Is this fine? For /read endpoint, is there a standard for parameters like “path=/data/format.md” or the parameter could be a plain english sentence like “path=show the data in format.md”? Are we concerned about what’s shown on the console if I run a /run command as long as it gets the job done? For tasks A1-10, are the file paths provided in the project doc standard or even they’re flexible? Ex. “Count the number of Wednesdays in file /data/format.md, and write just the number to /data/out.txt” +1 Dear Sir, Can we have a mentorship program for TDS for those who have no experience in programming like me ? thanks & regards.

For task A3, we have been asked to count wednesdays and the python file corresponding to A3 does count for wednesday alone. However the example says the LLM might be asked to count Sundays or other days. Should we be modifying task A3 code? Or was that just an example and only Wednesdays would need to be counted? @carlton @Jivraj Please respond . When will the project session be held? If I have missed it, can I get the recording? @carlton Tuesday is when we are currently planning a project session. Kind regards Tasks in Phase A are defined but that does not mean it has to do one precise thing. If that was the case then there is no use for an LLM. Your application should be able to take parse the input and be able to run commands that do similar things in parameterised fashion. It could be Wednesdays or Sundays or it might be in Arabic days or anything. So coding to precisely do something very specific is not the goal. The program has to be intelligent to do a certain type or class of tasks. We had a session introducing project. Week 3 session 1. But we will have a more hands on session on Tuesday.

Some questions about ‘B’ group tasks: Q1: For the following tasks (B5, B7, B9, and B10) tasks, how will input files be provided? Will it be URL or will datagen.py also generate files for these? Q2: For the above tasks as well as for B6 ( Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website), how should output be returned? Q3: In task B8, for transcribing audio file, which Python package is recommended or do we need to use OpenAI API? B5. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database B7.

It’s a bit difficult to dive into the project without guidance on how to do it.

I have been trying to do this. But have gotten nowhere until now. @carlton sir I request you demonstrate atleast few tasks, I spent last 2 days trying to implement but din’t reach anywhere, its really demotivating sir. Can you please demonstrate it by just doing One task or provide sample example code of 1 similar task in the way you explained here. It will be very helpful right now it is very confusing.

Hi Aindree, No its a typo (and will be corrected soon). In the context of what was written it clearly means it was updated on 27th January. The update being that the evaluation.py file was provided so that you could test your code against it. Thanks for bringing it to our attention. Kind regards Hi This would be only for a selected few questions right because say for the credit card question, where the LLM is involved, to get the card number itself, we have to give a fine-tuned and strong query. Try using the eval() function, that seemed to work for me @carlton @s.anand @Jivraj Sir, could you please share some guidance on the above? @jivraj,@carlton I have done the a1 to a10 task and tried querying through localhost and its working fine basically all these ten steps but dont know whether its enough or not. also steps in phase B i am confused that should we create separate endpoints for these tasks or should it be with same /run endpoint and query. then will the input be random by any user. what about the output . where should it be given. phase b needs more explanation. At what time will the session be happening tomorrow sir can you please give the details? Hi @carlton @Jivraj Facing some issues in running my project. Taking an example of the Phase A - A3 task.

Please use this for local llm to verify output Also Ollama doesn’t require Schemas CHECK OUT THE REPO AND ANY INPUTS ARE WELCOME Link to ReadMe and also repo Hi Andrew, You have done a great job with the Phase A tasks. Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy. I just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application. In other words getting 10/10 in evaluate.py does NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10 or 1/10 in the real evaluation. So do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of evaluate.py. It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general idea of the task. That said, evaluate.py is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application). Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty). Hope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.) A word of caution: (i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation) Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task (possibly your first task) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically. Kind regards Respected @s.anand @carlton and @Jivraj , Is anyone actively monitoring the Discourse page? I have been raising this issue for the past few days, but there has been no response. Does this mean the TAs are not addressing students’ concerns? I am encountering the following error while running my project with these LLM endpoints: https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings This issue is blocking my progress, and I urgently need assistance to resolve it. Kindly provide guidance or suggest a solution at the earliest. Looking forward to your response. Thanks, Telvin Varghese Hi, I am not able to understand how to do the Project 1. The date is also very near. The problem I am facing is, When I did the Modules the page was different, but now in the Project 1 I am not getting any section to submit the project. Please let me know where are the questions and how tot submit that. The deadline is near. carlton: o do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of evaluate.py. It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general idea of the task. This where I need help, i tried doing with agentic framework but i failed with the model in llm proxy, which was highly suspect because, that model should have known what the uv framework but it seemed to me to be outdated. Hence executing code Interpreter tools failed as the model gave outdated code. I have raised this issue before Hence i moved to function calling, using local llms as cost-effective solution and it was quite robust. I just need to understand how the function should be general, maybe 2-3 tasks you could provide the general description along with all the ways one would query the agent llm(ie our project). This general function is what i need help with. Please kindly do the needful. carlton: keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically. Any tentative size cutoff for the docker image? Hi Telvin You have run out of tokens. Thats what the message is saying. You ran out 3 days ago. It was clearly mentioned that the limit is $1. You have exceeded $2. Screenshot 2025-02-11 at 3.36.50 pm2078×1276 305 KB In our current internal build of project 1, we have yet to exceed $0.50 As to whether it can be renewed is something we have still not yet decided, because the question you have raised equally would apply to everyone. Raising it for you means raising it for everyone. $1 for everyone equals raising it by $1600+ (i.e Rs 1.39 Lakhs) for us! The budget question then involves more than one person. It also involves the BS Team Operations and not just the TDS team and therefore instead of responding with a response that is not useful, we typically try to solve the problem first and then respond. In short we are working on it. But as we have mentioned repeatedly in our sessions, use APIs efficiently, thats part of the skill. As soon as we have a resolution we will inform everyone via an announcement and an email. Kind regards Thanks for your response, @Carlton. It seems I won’t be able to proceed with the project until this issue is resolved. Also, I haven’t used LLM so much until February 7th to cost $2. Every request you send, gives you a response back with exactly how much that request cost. So you can track your usage. I’m aware of that. I’ve mostly noticed a cost of $0.0003 per request, so I haven’t been tracking my total monthly expenses. Moving forward, I’ll keep a record of the cost for each request. Also, do strong prompts impact the overall cost? @carlton Is the project session happening today? I don’t have the link. Can you please send it if it’s happening?

LINK TO PAGE WITH CODE EXAMPLE Screenshot 2025-02-11 232608919×714 22.4 KB correct code in step 2 collection query step response = ollama.embed( model=\"nomic-embed-text:latest\", input=task ) results = collection.query( query_embeddings=response[\"embeddings\"], #here embeddings and also not list of list as response embeddings already gives correct format n_results=1 ) data = results['documents'][0][0] @s.anand @Jivraj @carlton @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj While implementing the Phase B tasks, can I take the data (csv file, git repo, audio, sqlite/duckdb database, website, image and markdown file) of my choice and perform any operation on them as long as they meet the critetia mentioned in the Phase B task list? Please guide. @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj In the Task B5, where we have to run an SQL query on a sqlite or duckdb database, should I create a database on my own and then take the query to be ran on it as an argument? Or should I take the query as an argument and run it on the ticker_sales.db in ./data folder? Please guide same issue on my side as well on using the AIPROXY_TOKEN from here https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/ getting this error : Error: Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer. @carlton @Jivraj please help! @carlton @Jivraj Can the link to the live session (for project) be provided? As in the previous session for task a1 we use llm just to get the url and email , so after retriving the both arguments can i use them in a function and got the work given in work done in function. Also, am i correct that we use llm only to retrive url or location ?? @carlton @Jivraj Anyone whom have done have done any one task of phase a and one task of phase b, please help… Can you do one task from each phase in today’s session. Please @carlton @Jivraj thanks for the reply I will check TDS project Tedious project can anyone share the link of yesterdays live session if there in youtube Its updated in the TDS live sessions playlist For task A2: A2. Format the contents of /data/format.md using prettier@3.4.2, updating the file in-place I am getting the following error: 🔴 A2 failed: Command '['npx', 'prettier@3.4.2', '--stdin-filepath', '/data/format.md']' returned non-zero exit status 1. However, running a POST request to https://localhost:8000/run?task=Format+/data/format.md+with+prettier+3.4.2 gives successful output. {\"success\":true,\"message\":\"Formatted and verified successfully!\"}% Here is my code snippet: def format_file(filepath): while True: # Loop until formatting and verification pass try: result = subprocess.run( [\"npx\", \"prettier@3.4.2\", \"--write\", filepath], check=False, # Don't raise exception automatically capture_output=True, text=True ) if result.returncode != 0: return {\"success\": False, \"message\": f\"Prettier write failed: {result.stderr}\"} if verify_prettier_formatting(filepath): return {\"success\": True, \"message\": \"Formatted and verified successfully!\"} else: logging.info(\"Verification failed.

I am getting the same error. Did you find any solution? Has anyone succeeded in the extraction of credit cards details task? The LLM seems to consider it as illegal task and if I use pytessaract the docker image size will become really large. What to do in this case? @carlton @Jivraj Hi @carlton @Jivraj, I followed what you taught in Feb 11 session and tried implementing task A1. My understanding is once i run the subprocess, datagen.py file should be run and /data folder should be created in the project folder. But it is not happening to me. I am getting the following error Traceback (most recent call last): File \"/var/folders/rj/z_3b8hl51558519w90k5hp600000gn/T/datagen4COEF3.py\", line 284, in <module> os.makedirs(config[\"root\"], exist_ok=True) ~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ File \"<frozen os>\", line 227, in makedirs OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system: '/data' If i can’t automate this process, i don’t see the point writing code for other tasks. Can anyone help me solving this error? shell = true in evaluate.py, remove it meaning comment it out, task a2 thats causing the error the admin banned me from using laughing emoji @jkmadathil For task

Asking this seemingly obvious question, as (apparently) the actual AIPROXY_TOKEN is not to be included anywhere in the code, or the repository, or the dockerfile. I am also facing the same issue, just that the ordering is different. Sorting by keys also didn’t help. Please help on this @carlton @Jivraj sir will the tasks of Phase A and Phase B change? like currently do we need to make llm write the code for all tasks dynamically or can we write a pre defined

Screenshot from 2025-02-12 20-21-561501×564 61.8 KB running in docker? //////////////////////////// Yes, I commented out check=True to see the error @carlton @Jivraj could you please help me out on how to start with TDS Project-1, as I am stuck at the moment and don’t know where to start from. This project is very much unfamiliar for me and I need some guidance on how to start with it. It would be really great if you could provide some help through resources/materials/videos and help me complete the project. Thanks in advance! then im not sure exactly wait lemme check issue with evaluate py, specifically , how it formats the file, maybe shell=True should be uncommented if commented out. then im not sure. Im not in composing docker files yet Could anyone please help me with the project… I am trying to do it but I’m always getting errors even while starting. My final docker image size is coming 1.25 gb, I am using the ubuntu base image as I thought it would be appropriate given the tasks. Is it ok with that size? PS - Also I would be running out of token if I need to test again with some other base image now. @carlton Go through the week 1-3 assignments once, you would be good to go with Phase A tasks. @23f2003413 @AnvithaV You do not need the whole of ubuntu! Just python and uv More like 128mb image. Please watch Tues week 5 session 1 Kind regards Will there be more live sessions on project ? @carlton I could pull it down to 610 mb, using python:3.9-slim now, but there are some essential libraries that is needed which is taking up the space…will it be ok? I mean installing on the go with uv might lead to timeout during evaluation… How did you corrected it ? I tried cutting it down further but it is affecting the functionality, this is the best I can do, i.e., 610 mb could you help later, when i need to construct docker image, via gmeet?

But in evaluate.py tasks are defined by different variables to test and when I’m testing it using python evaluate.py it returns unsuccessful . I’m testing all my tasks of main.py with Postman it returns successful. My query is that how the tasks get evaluated and do i need to change my variables in main.py ? And what are the other things i have to change. Also plss update evaluate.py fie with phase B tasks @s.anand @carlton @Saransh_Saini @22f3001777 Yes there will be one more session today (13th Feb) at usual time 8pm to 10pm Kind regards Hi instructors and TAs, For the different tasks in Phase B, I don’t have a clear idea of what type of a response you expect. eg. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database & Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website & Transcribe audio from an MP3 file - Do you want the query’s response on an output file like A10? or as a response? I understand that these are broad problems you except us to solve, but it would be helpful to know what type of response you would require. Thanks, Trebhuvan Hi, Pls tell us how to use evaluate.py script to check our codes Output specifications will be detailed in the “task” sent to the endpoint. Phase B is meant to be vague because if you can solve it, without an elaborate and gratuitous use of gpt function calling, then you can actually solve all tasks using the same function ! Kind regards Okay sure!! Ping me when you require to generate… Hello sir, Is yesterday’s session not uploaded to YouTube yet ? I couldn’t find it in calendar either… It will be very helpful if you (or anyone else) could provide yesterday session’s recording’s link… 21f2000709: I tried cutting it down further but it is affecting the functionality, this is the best I can do, i.e., 610 mb @carlton @Jivraj will it be ok? Actually I developed it in a way that require some of the essential dependencies and at this point of time it would be dangerous to alter the way of handling it as I am running short of AIProxy Token credits. Earlier when I asked this: 21f2000709: Any tentative size cutoff for the docker image? I could have altered my way of handling dependencies but at that point of time there was no clear numbers. I request you to please allow this time around with this size… @carlton Could you please consider extending the submission date of Assignment 5 (it is 16th Feb right now). We are very busy with the project. And assignment 6 submission date is much later: 9th of March. @carlton +1 Agreed, a relaxation in deadline will be a boon for students who’ve taken up other projects this term. usage of langchain is allowed? It will be extended, @carlton mentioned it in a TA session already. Hi @Rishabh2 What exactly you mean by variables? only one argument is required for running evaluate.py that’s an email address. You need to download both evaluate.py and datagen.py in same folder and then execute evaluate.py using uv. uv run evaluate.py --email $any_email. For phase B Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025] Tools in Data Science Output specifications will be detailed in the “task” sent to the endpoint. Phase B is meant to be vague because if you can solve it, without an elaborate and gratuitous use of gpt function calling, then you can actually solve all tasks using the same function ! Kind regards Kind regards 610 Mb’s is good size, no need to worry, it will be evaluated. Hi @23f1002382 This is the classic case where you use Prompt engineering to solve your problems. I assume you have already achieved your answers, but I want to clarify this for someone who is facing this problem. The thing is GPT-4o-mini is intelligent enough to understand what kind of task you are asking it do, and extracting Credit Card info from an image is one of the many prohibited tasks. What you can do is, try to fool it using itself. Just ask ChatGPT to generate a prompt that would be capable of fooling itself into extracting out that credit card info. I was capable of doing it after pretending to be a working on a Cyber Security project, and other fake details which ChatGPT itself provided me with. @carlton . I cannot send requests to https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1 . Getting $RateLimitError: Error code: 429 - {‘message’: 'On 2025-02 you used $2.0003758999999954, exceeding 2'} . Looks like I used all of my credit . What can I do now ? Project is also Incomplete. Try creating a better prompt for this task. Hint: Ask it to recheck certain similar looking digits. After submitting docker image through, it will be pulled and our token will be used. Things to be checked at your end. 1. podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME works fine 2. Above command will start 8000 server so use evaluate.py to test if things are working as expected. Kind regards. Jivraj Hi @JoelJeffrey What you did wrong and how did you correct it? I think there was something wrong with the way the code was getting inputs (keys). I just rewrote that part and it worked Hi @22f3001307 Provide required write permissions to /data folder. We will also discuss this issue regarding permissions in initial part of today’s session. Kind regards Hello sir, Is yesterday’s session not uploaded to YouTube yet ? I couldn’t find it in calendar either… Command to run the image in the docs, seemed to have some error, The command: podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 gives the error: crun: executable file `-e` not found in $PATH: No such file or directory: OCI runtime attempted to invoke a command that was not found However the correct command seems to be: podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=\"$AIPROXY_TOKEN\" -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME This works totally fine. @Jivraj nvm i can laugh nw xD One final question @Jivraj @carlton , will our projects be evaluated with our AIPROXY_TOKEN or a different one. Because my project is done but for evaluation if my AIPROXY_TOKEN is used, it might be out of credits. Thanks. Do you know the new date? That wasn’t said, but it was not this weekend for sure. my automation is happening and prompt distribution too but it just isnt able to pass any test after 1st in evaluation.py did someone else face same problem if yes then how to solve it please help actually that easyocr is directly sending the clear text(no confusion) to llm and llm is just extracting the exact numbers from it .

Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website B3. Fetch data from an API and save it They are almost similar and it’s getting confusing in both cases, it’s given output based on B3 and not reading the input for B6, so could you please help me out with this? Is anyone else facing this or a similar issue? Two solutions give proper permissions. use docker containers this is what we will test on. I would prefer 2nd approach For B tasks use LLM to write code on the fly and execute it, use better prompts. In evaluation script detailed task will be provided with what data needs to be scraped, endpoints, parameters, etc. {‘error’: {‘message’: “Invalid ‘tools[6].function.description’: string too long. Expected a string with maximum length 1024, but got a string with length 4384 instead.”, ‘type’: ‘invalid_request_error’, ‘param’: ‘tools[6].function.description’, ‘code’: ‘string_above_max_length’}, ‘monthlyCost’: 0.08569882000000002, ‘cost’: 0, ‘monthlyRequests’: 82} i cant send long prompts then what is the point? local llm also we cant use you because you have some limit on file size, we send long prompt also it doesn’t work xD . What do we do? @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @anybodywhowouldatleastreplyONCE Hi, If you read these questions carefully then they are not similar, one is asking you to extract data from a webpage, meaning you have to do something related to the HTML code. And the other is simply sending a request to a given endpoint. Hi @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj , In task A6 Find all Markdown (.md ) files in /data/docs/ . For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with # ). Create an index file /data/docs/index.json that maps each filename (without the /data/docs/ prefix) to its title (e.g. {\"README.md\": \"Home\", \"path/to/large-language-models.md\": \"Large Language Models\", ...} ). Here expected output JSON “key” is file name or file path without prefix /data/docs/ as prompt is bit confusing . when “path/to/large-language-models.md” is given in example is actually referring to file path or filename itself is “path/to/large-language-models.md”. This can easily be checked by runing the evaluate.py file. Anyways, a file present in data/docs/folder_a/folder_b/md_file should be folder_a/folder_b/md_file as key. hey @23f2001975 did you find the solution to this problem ? i am facing the exact same issue @carlton Sir, my token limit has crossed the $1 limit. Will I receive new limit or a fresh token ? I still need to complete my project.

DONE WITH A TASK , you have to create DOCKER IMAGE THOUGH < HAVE ENV file with keys , check the key value pair names, an cheers guy , we all get 9 marks hopefully For as task description like this Write the # of Thursdays in /data/extracts.txt into /data/extracts-count.txt I have given the prompt in such detail to the LLM but it is still not able to understand the task because of the “#” symbol. The task is getting truncated even before it reaches to the LLM. Can anyone help me on this because I have tried so many things to fix this but nothing seems to help. Hi @Jivraj, @carlton sir, I have created a docker file and run the application but it’s throwing error for A2 task No such file or directory: ‘npx’ Do i need give the node install in docker file? Hash is just another way of writing “number” @carlton @Jivraj sir i have tried to solve the A1. when I want to check the solution we are asked for the datagen module as the evaluate.py have ’ ''from datagen import ( get_markdown, get_dates, get_contacts, get_logs, get_docs, get_email, get_credit_card, get_comments, get_tickets, ) ''' so do we need to download the datagen.py in the local system first… Or it should be the part of the automation only… I am getting internal server error for task A1, I have been trying for a long time. It may be possible that i have issues with my ai_proxy token thus tell how to properly set the taken. Yes I know that but LLM does not know that # indicates number. And no prompt is fixing this issue because the task has to be passed as query parameter and by the time LLM reads the task, it is already half gone due to #. Where to find AIProxy token from? what if we are out of token sir how do we complete our project then? could u share your code once i think you should explicitly try to install npx in your code 23f1002382: ANDIECOOLER2 could you help me out with q2? Can you tell me where to get the AIPROXY Token from and also are u able to execute docker image push command it keeps showing as an error to me def format_with_prettier(file_path:str, prettier_version:str): if file_path and os.path.exists(file_path): print('Path exisit - will perform prettier') subprocess.run([\"npx\", f\"prettier@{prettier_version}\", \"--write\", file_path]) else: raise FileNotFoundError() This is my code this isnt also working are you sure its right? image1027×917 28.1 KB okay but in my docker image when i tried to run that in local, its asking for npx and it doesnt work @carlton could you please give a hint as to why this isnt working im running locally first and then will use docker when i get a 10/10 score Okay, actually when i tried with local, i’m facing path error ./data/format.md [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified So that’s why i moved to docker but there also i’m getting error for A2. you should manually check if the file really exists or not because i think the code and the folder where datagen.py is downloading files(data folder) are different yes yes i moved the folder to current working directory If you are using the function calling approach, you could just parse the ‘#’ and change it to ‘number’ and then send the prompt to the llm for that particular task. Or another approach is tell the llm, If you ever see the phrase ‘count the # of’ in a task, please interpret it as ‘count the number of’.

Please read the deliverables and evalute section. datagen.py and evaluate.py were for only for your testing purposes so that you have an idea of the workflow and how the evaluation works. They are NOT part of your project submission. Only DO what the project page tells you in the deliverables and evalute sections.

Hey @carlton @Jivraj , I actually submitted the project already in the morning, I included all the deliverables and things mentioned in the evaluation section. But since I was actively testing with the - datagen.py and evaluate.py, I forgot to remove them before submission. However these files do not play a role in my project execution in any way, they just sit idle. Will there be any issue? when trying to use function call way of open api tools = [ { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"extract_email_sender\", \"description\": \"Extract sender email from a specific file in directory\", \"parameters\": {}, \"strict\": True } }, { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"count_day_of_week\", \"description\": \"To count the occurances of a specific day of a week in a file with various dates\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"day_of_week\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"day of week\" } }, \"required\": [\"day_of_week\"], \"additionalProperties\": False }, \"strict\": True } } ] payload = { \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini\", \"messages\": [ {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input}, ], \"tools\": tools, \"tool_choice\": \"auto\", \"max_tokens\": 500, \"temperature\": 0.7 } facing the below issue ror’: {‘message’: “Invalid type for ‘tools[0]’: expected an object, but got an array instead.” when i run POST request t is showing output “HTTP/1.1 200 OK” but when i give GET request it is showing HTTP/1.1\" 404 Not Found. Can you please say how can it be solved These files are inside a separate folder - evaluation in my project root directory. Since I already submitted please do consider. Thanks & Regards Pradeep This indicates your task execution returns “HTTP/1.1 200 OK” but the execution doesn’t creates the required file in the given location that the evaluation script is requesting.

Thanks The reason in the lecture they were using ./data was because they were debugging in their local machine not in the docker. For the docker image (the official submission) you must use /data. It is a clear requirement mentioned in the project page. Thats why it works fine when you use it in the docker image.

Specially after the release of the sessions… Whole day and night have gone like nothing, infront of the computer… Plz sir understand the situation and extend the deadline… 23f2003413: http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1 For me it says invalid path @carlton @Jivraj same issue happening with me even though working for last whole week only got 4 correct . please extend some time so we can complete the project as weekends are the time when we get a day off from our primary college and can work with full attention on this project. it usually happens in some GNU/Linux OS. since you are using some distribution based on Debian namely Ubuntu or whatever try doing sudo apt install python-packagename (replace package name with fastapi for fastapi) then it works. It usually happens due to manual intervention with pip3 the user might break some system dependencies which require some python3 package. No need to worry about it. Another Fix: try using a virtual environment which is highly suggested since there is no chance for you to interfere with the system packages. create a venv using python3 -m venv name_of_venv add this line to your .bashrc in ~ folder as source /path/to/your/venv/location and run source .bashrc. This time no error occurs as you do everything in your virtual environment you can install anything python3 package using pip3 install package name. It even happened for me Screenshot_20250215_1433573841×1009 237 KB Most of your questions and doubts will be solved in todays sessions.

Hi Thanks. Yes. it works when venv is created. But I see that it was working find in Week 5-Session 1 video without creating virtual environment. I will not submit project. Get authentication token from this AI Proxy and usage and follow documentation for sending requests. sanand0/aiproxy: Authorizing proxy for LLMs No Problems, just fill form with correct image name in google forms. yes npx will require node to be installed. @Jivraj when would today’s live session be conducted and how can we attend it sir evaluate.py is not working sir. What if you run out of credits during or just before final evaluation? This is only for testing on local machine. In docker image keep /data. One session is going live right now (from 3 to 5 pm).

I even tried to set the current project folder as the root directory but it still downloads the files in C drive and I cant seem to find a workaround this. Can someone please help with this issue. Thanks! Can you please make the changes in the datagen.py file config = {“root”: “/data”} This is where I have been facing the issue. The only solution I can think of is moving the /data folder from the root to the project directory. which I am not sure is a good way to solve this issue. @carlton please tell do we have to put this url in a variable for A1 task ? https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py Task A9 fails.

Humble request to extend the deadline please. Finding it extremely difficult and having time atleast till Sunday will be really helpful for working professionals like me All my tasks are running except A9. I have created a .env file and added my token. Despite that I ran commands in both the terminals. A9 still fails. I second this, have been trying to debug the project for the past 1 week, spending over 4 hours daily and yet facing issues everytime I reopen. An extension of even 24 hours would be extremely appreciated. Please consider this. Thanks. same issue on my side as well how u did A2 could u please share ? @s.anand @jivraj @carlton AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN what abt m url stuff? Sir, I request you to Please extend the deadline, Because it is time consuming and regular Students and Working professionals have only saturday and sunday to complete this project. Thanks also, in evaluate.py file, the embedding url is wrong and the AIPROXY_TOKEN is changed to OPENAI_API_TOKEN or something. i could send you edited evaluate.py… check your messages on discourse On bash it gives below output.

Do I need to submit the docker image name with the tag or without the tag? I submitted it before without the tag. Now i see that I have tagged the image with as v1 but I cant submit the form due to pattern matching problems.

Can’t use it since 2 dollar limit has been crossed. Please help. @carlton @Jivraj Yes I also need the answer of this. Is there any way of figuring what is the usage of my token and if yes then how… Plz some peers help… It will be corrected soon by @jkmadathil He is in charge of our budget for TDS and the tokens are being issued by him. Please tag him for any token related issues. New token assigned to the students. Emails are also sent. sir I am noticing a pattern, that when I am running the datagen first. And then using the evaluate.py, then I am getting the A2 right. But running the evaluation.py for the 2nd time cause the A2 to fail… Probabbly Because the file in the data folder gets upated should I worry for that… in the phase B, we have no idea about how many arguments are there, so should we make every function mapping with 2 arguments ( 1 containing the input location and other containing output location) or should we take the parameters in some other way There has been an outage in some parts of the country related to cloudflare servers. What helped some students (and us) is using a completely different network eg. instead of using your home wifi, use mobile internet, since they go through a different DNS and this sometimes works. Kind regards We have not specified a size limit for the docker image, so in theory there is not a limit to the docker image size. Kind regards Hello @carlton Sir, While running evaluate.py , I have observed that the expected and actual output is having difference like “\\n” then also it marks task as fail. eg: EXPECTED: Cover west give likely individual though question inside.

The reason for error is evaluate.py is trying to import datagen.py which doesn’t exist in your system. I’ll suggest download both the files, keep them in same folder and run evaluate.py from your computer Yes actually Thats my doubt , when I run both in same folder it is working , but only after task a1 runs datagen.py will be downloaded in /data folder right ?, or did I misunderstood something??

For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with # ). Create an index file /data/docs/index.json that maps each filename (without the /data/docs/ prefix) to its title (e.g. {\"README.md\": \"Home\", \"path/to/large-language-models.md\": \"Large Language Models\", ...} ) …I am getting correct result for all files but for the very first file budget.md it shows wrong. my result- { “budget.md”: “Success easy same main modern doctor.”, “build.md”: “Shoulder follow own never above.”, and in the data files there is different heading in budget.md.- # Series dog who make specific agree between. my question is this if it works for all the files then why not for this file budget.md @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj @carlton do you able to do this task * A5. Write the first line of the 10 most recent .log file in /data/logs/ to /data/logs-recent.txt, most recent first … i am also doing using prompt no hard-coded. yes doing this only but finding correct for most of the files. yes i am able to do task a5. so you directly using prompt for doing this task. yes i am only using prompt based method If filename has number in its name then extract the number from the filename and convert it to an integer before sorting .Ensure numbers inside filenames are compared as integers, not as strings, to maintain proper order. Sort filenames in said in task. Avoid any lexicographical sorting issues. i am using this extra info for doing this but still it does not give accurate result. can you help me in this i already shared my repo u can check there. you have pushed data,datagen and evaluate files…do we have to submit them as well?? (also send the docker file) Check the file once, there is a possibility that it’s either fetching a comment or the second heading. Refactor your prompt to search only for the First Heading, specify it explixitly. okay let me check once. one more thing sir {“first_name”: “Crystal”, “last_name”: “Wilson”, “email”: “delgadorebecca@example.com”} then what will be the sorted-contact for this as in email there is no first and lastname present. @Saransh_Saini Hey, I submitted the project links in the google form yesterday but, today in the portal it shows that I have not submitted the project. I am getting this error while running evaluate.py on task A9 HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings \"HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\" 🔴 A9 failed: 'data' There were no authentication issues till yesterday. please guide @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini This is happening because evaluate.py is unable to fetch your API Key from the environment variables. Create a new variable and set it’s value to your API Key then try. Hi everyone, I’m running into an issue with the AI Proxy embeddings endpoint while executing the A9 task. Every time I send a POST request to: bash Copy https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings I receive a 401 Unauthorized response. This, in turn, causes my code to fail with a KeyError: 'data' because the expected JSON response doesn’t include the \"data\" key. What I’ve Tried Token Verification: I’m using the AIPROXY_TOKEN obtained by logging in at aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev with my IITM email. The token is passed in the header as follows: python Copy \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {AIPROXY_TOKEN}\" I added debug prints to confirm that the token is being used correctly (printing the first few characters). API Request Details: The request includes the correct Content-Type: application/json header. The payload is set as: json Copy {\"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": [\"Test\"]} Despite this, the response status is consistently 401 Unauthorized. Debug Output: Here’s a snippet of the debug output: bash Copy HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings \"HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\" 🔴 A9 failed: 'data' This confirms that the issue is with the authentication rather than our processing logic. What I Suspect The token may be invalid, expired, or misconfigured. There could be changes in the token permissions or endpoint requirements that I’m not aware of. Alternatively, there might be an issue on the server side with token validation. Request for Help Has anyone else encountered this issue recently? Could someone verify if there are any changes to the authentication requirements for the embeddings endpoint? Any insights or updated instructions on how to ensure the token is valid and has the proper permissions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your assistance! B5. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database Should I ask for the SQL data base. Or the agent should be smart enough to find the required database… Moreover in the data folder there is only one database is it should be robust to handle multiple databases… same issue i also face pls sir help us fix this issue and provide us more token HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings “HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests” A9 failed: ‘data’ @Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini I had a question on evaluation by the course team. To test that my application would run everywhere, I first deleted all images from my local machine using podman rmi -a and then ran podman run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN $IMAGE_NAME with the appropriate variables set. This is as per the instructions provided here. But this gave me the following error: Error: short-name \"freshbash/dataworks-agent\" did not resolve to an alias and no unqualified-search registries are defined in \"/etc/containers/registries.conf The above is the format in which we have to provide the image name in the Google form. So, I was confused whether this would succeed during actual evaluation. The only way its working right now is when I specify the image name to be docker.io/freshbash/dataworks-agent I’m not yet very good with how containers work so some insights would be very helpful.

Someone help (if you didn’t get this mail). @carlton @Jivraj @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Hi, I received a mail saying that my submission has no Dockerfile. But git repo has a dockerfile. even if i am to submit again, i have submit the same repo. what should i do? Hey I just got a mail saying that my github repo has no Dockerfile present. and im confused . It doesnt mention anywhere that the dockerfile must be present in the root directory as a requirement/prerequisite of the project. In my case its present inside the app directory. Could the team help clarify on this issue. @Jivraj @carlton What is expected repo structure ? I have a folder in my repo and dockerfile and license are present in that folder but I still received a mail regarding missing License and Dockerfile. do we need to have data folder in repo no right? No, it is not needed We see that your submission GitHub - 22f3001011/project-1 has a result of FAIL due to the below reasons: No “MIT” in LICENSE Hello sir, i got this mail despite having added the mit license as stated in the project problem statement. I cant figure out what the issue is, and help me out here. @carlton @Jeeveash.k github.com GitHub - 22f3001011/project-1 main Contribute to 22f3001011/project-1 development by creating an account on GitHub. Thank you Regards Shashank J Shetth 22f3001011 Yeah. Same issue. Someone who didn’t get this error, please share the MIT license. https://github.com/saniyanz/tds-p1new check my repo. whats wrong. Ive also got the mail but I`ve included the MIT License and the Dockerfile Rename LICENSE.txt to LICENSE I got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‘dockerfile’. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm. Shall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile? Hey team, I just moved my Dockerfile to the root level on my Github repo. Hope this solves the issue. Small doubt: Do i need to submit the google form again? I ran out of tokens. Please help me. Please its urgent. @carlton sir @s.anand sir please provide me more tokens, I am out of tokens i don’t knwo what happened i hade 151 requests use and 0.09 usd and suddenly i check it was 300 requests and 2 usd i don’t knwo what happened can you provide me more tokens. Dear @s.anand , @carlton , @Jivraj , and @Saransh_Saini Thank you all for this wonderful project. Coming from a non-coding background, I have learned a lot new things throughout this project building process. @carlton Sir, yesterday’s session provided valuable insights into Method 1 (prompt engineering) for dynamically handling tasks. I was able to develop an application using this approach; however, due to submission time constraints, I could not verify all tasks (my bad). While I tested some tasks and found the results to be highly accurate, I was unable to validate everything thoroughly. Therefore, I submitted the function-calling approach (Method 2) instead. I sincerely appreciate everyone’s guidance and support. Did you ran out of tokens suddenly like me ? How many requests have you sent in total ? can u share ur repo i really need it Thanks @lakshaygarg654 for this feedback. Glad to know you learned from our efforts, it means a lot. This proves that even a person from non-tech background with determination can achieve it. sir pls provide more token @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj @s.anand sir pls , give any reply we have only 2 hr left Change the name of your dockerfile to “Dockerfile” yes sir please provide more tokens to me also @s.anand @Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini i hope i get 1 mark xD im getting tasks only maybe 3 / 10 i have done many attempt but it is not working please show my environment saying fastapi is not installed but i have installed and it is showing on checking but no running file it is saying no module i have installed in both virtual and system please help image1919×1016 117 KB this problem occuring sir since two days How long does it take to make a docker image, I’ve been doing it for the past 25 minutes and it’s still not completed. Your LLM app should be designed like it can give desire result based on task desc at run endpoint, and that result should be accessible at read endpoint. Evaluation file just for reference to check how things works and it works for phase A tasks only. Also ensure datagen.py file and evaluation.py file are latest. There is one issue in evaluation.py file for task A1, link of datagen.py file not correct, rectify that link. Even it corrected in GitHub repo file but when I download that raw file in local system it takes back previous link. I WONDER HOW MANY API REQUESTS THE SERVER IS PROCESSING . It’s too slow too much in the last few hours it feel I guess what is done is done. I should have maintained my version history properly. I am getting 4 correct but with minor formatting issues so only 1 correct I guess. It was tough… I will probably not score much but I enjoyed it a lot. Thank you for pushing us so hard. At least I am not scared of docker now and function calling feels easier than before. Well done, everyone! This is not an easy project. This is the kind of work our clients are asking us for. I will keep you posted on the evaluation on this thread, it progresses. 2025-02-16T18:31:00Z Google Form closed 2025-02-16T18:35:00Z Validating submissions. Will post results shortly Sir i have missed the submission deadline by 5 minutes, can you give permission for the google form to accept the response for half an hour more. Sir, due to time panic, I mistakenly named the Docker image incorrectly. Sir can you please allow submission for 5 more minutes? A post was merged into an existing topic: Project 1 - Casual banter @s.anand @carlton Dear Sir, I am writing to you in a state of distress and humility. An unfortunate mistake on my part has led to the upload of an incorrect Docker image link. When I checked the authenticity of the link, it showed an error, even though the GitHub repository link is functioning perfectly. I have poured my heart and soul into this project, dedicating countless hours and sleepless nights to ensure its success. The project has successfully passed both Test A and Test B, and I was thrilled to see my hard work paying off. However, this single error has left me devastated. I am pleading with you, with all my heart, to allow me to correct this mistake by updating the Docker image link. Alternatively, I humbly request that my application be reviewed directly through GitHub. Please consider this an exception, as I have worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to create an application that is 890 lines long. I beg for your understanding and leniency in this matter. This project means the world to me, and I am genuinely sobbing over this setback. Thank you for considering my heartfelt request. Sincerely, Rishit Jain (24F2004595) Although couldn’t complete handling every task, but really enjoyed working on this project and learned a lot throughout the process. I appreciate the opportunity to work on such an engaging project. For Project 2, I’ll make sure to allocate sufficient time and approach it with even greater commitment. Sorry @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj Sir, due to time panic, I mistakenly named the Docker image incorrectly. Just push the latest image to docker asap. Hopefully the team considers it. True. Same here. Just giving 2 days for this project was definitely a big mistake on my part… but I couldn’t really give more time due to work commitments. @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj Sir, due to time panic, I mistakenly named the Docker image incorrectly. I am not 100% sure but i guess i used “ii” instead of “i” in “thevixhal/tdsvishal”… is there any way to check this ? Can the submissions open just for some time? In minutes? Many students did silly mistakes due toh nervousness, we can just correct it. I don’t think the project is too difficult to implement—it’s essentially a simple HTTP API for an AI agent that reads a task, converts it into parameters, and passes those parameters to specific functions to complete the task. However, the instructions in the project question aren’t very clear. Before the session, I am unable to fully understand the question. It took me almost an entire day just to understand what we need to do. Sir Could you provide test cases or a sample answer for Phase B? @s.anand @carlton sorry to disturb you, project1 deadline is over. I made a mistake in my project. In my call llm function i set some payload instead of default for open ai api call like max token, temp. , n, stop etc. Due to this, some tasks may fail especially credit card image task will fail 100%, if possible can i just remove that payload from git hub repository . or you can check this call llm function present in my task_handler.py file of my repository. I found this issue after deadline. If possible consider this request. I never engaged in a project or course like for this one. I love this project genuinely. my github repo : GitHub - 21f3001076/TDS_Project_1: This is IITM Data Science TDS Course Project 1 Repository Thankyou Lakshay student id: 21f3001076@ds.study.iitm.ac.in Dear @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj , Thank you so much for this wonderful project! We have learned so many things from this experience, especially the power of prompts. The team has put in tremendous effort, extending a few sessions and patiently clearing all our doubts. We truly appreciate the dedication and support Regards, Arjun I would like to sincerely thank the course faculty @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini for their support on the project throughout the week. They were so patient in listening to our issues and helping us resolve them, even if the issues were repeated. I was not able to complete some or maybe many of the tasks but overall, it was a very good learning for me, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Thanks very much again for your guidance and support. Regards, Swati Thanks for your compliments Swati. It’s always nice to know our efforts paid off. Happy Learning I have received a mail that my project has \"\"No “MIT” in LICENSE;No Dockerfile \" which I saw today. My project has MIT licence and Dockerfile was also there… but to reconfirm I pulled my dockerfile from dockerhub to github only . NOw am not sure will that be considered now in my project submission or not. Requesting to kindly consider current state of my project in submission for my project. WOMP WOMP should i call a wambulance? (post deleted by author) @all those who didn’t submit, its ok EVEN I did NOT submit. Even though i get zero, i am happy with the learning i did. Once again thank you sir @carlton @s.anand . This a been awesome experience , i haven’t been this alive in forever. Cheers. I noticed something quite funny. The project never specified the required tech stack, so one could have done this entirely with JavaScript as well, assuming the necessary libraries are installed. @TheVishal EDIT: Create a new docker image with the mistaken image name , so when they pull image from repo, that image with the wrong name also gets pulled. what to do push a new image with the mistaken name, so in your repo there will be two images how will this help? since you are unsure, which image link you posted, you can be sure that even you had a mistake in link, a new image will exist with the wrong name after you push another image @all use this to update your image even after submission, as now they only validate the images, they do not pull it so you can edit your project and add more functionality if they release the code solutiion CHEERS Andrew OUT. I didn’t submit the google form, I have made the github repo and docker image for TDS project 1. I, mistakenly, thought that I had submitted the google form but actually it was saved as a draft and closed my laptop. As soon as I realized my mistake, I hit the submit button but this was shown then, “The form TDS Jan 2025 - Project 1 Submission is no longer accepting responses.” I apologize for this. I have been working on this project for weeks. This was my first TDS project. I would highly appreciated, if you could help me. Thankyou GitHub repo:GitHub - Sagankaur/TDS_project1: LLM-based automation agent Docker : sagandeep/tds_project1 Sir, can we get the evaluation script now @carlton @s.anand If I am not wrong you were getting 9/10 in task A when many of us were stuck and you didn’t submit… unbelievable Thank you, sir, for giving us this amazing opportunity! Honestly, I learned more in the last week than I did throughout the three modules. The project was a rollercoaster ride—especially with all the errors that kept popping up—but overall, the experience was incredibly enriching. The amount of knowledge I gained was truly valuable. A huge thanks to @Carlton, @Saransh_Saini, and @Jivraj sir for their guidance and support. Without the last week’s lectures, the project couldn’t have been completed. i couldn’t my code space ran out of compute and then it was just lagging before i found out what happened , i just submitted old code repo and the image the we created in week 2 or week1 when had to create docker image for graded assignments EDIT: Screenshot 2025-02-16 0911011351×292 13.3 KB Screenshot 2025-02-17 2004141338×200 18.2 KB Screenshot 2025-02-17 2005251312×321 18.5 KB Wait we had limits in codespace…I didn’t thought much of it but now that I see… …even mine is not so far from the limit…thanks for reminding…gotta be careful in next project @carlton @Jivraj Is there something like peer-review in the project, I found this in the grading document. Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 1.00.50 PM126×226 2.02 KB This project is one of the best experiences I had in the entire degree program. I could say this without any hesitation that what I learnt in the past 10 days >> last 3 months. I really appreciate the idea of open internet type of evaluations, wherein, you implement things without any constraints, learning for the sake of implementing. Doing this project, I also found many new ideas wherein function calling can be used to solve new problems. I also learned many new things from enthusiastic peers like @23f1002382 and also got the chance to help a few. I thank the entire TDS team - @s.anand sir, @carlton , @Jivraj for their support throughout this amazing experience.

Kind regards Thanks @21f2000709 for kind words Tagging Saransh for his efforts to project @Saransh_Saini. @23f1002382 most active student on this post thanks to you too. Kind regards 21f2000709: @carlton @Jivraj Is there something like peer-review in the project, I found this in the grading document. Anyone having any idea on this? No human peer reviews. The peer will be an LLM that has been given the rubrics and fine tuned. Kind regards carlton: The peer will be an LLM that has been given the rubrics and fine tuned. May the peer give me good marks @carlton Would the scores of project 1 be released tomorrow? @Yogesh1 We do not have an ETA on Project 1 scores yet. Might have more clarity soon. Project 1 scores will be available roughly second week of March. Kind regards @lakshaygarg654 I know this is a late reply, but its not possible for us to consider changes to your project after the deadline for academic integrity purposes. If we were to allow it, we would have to allow everyone to make changes to their project as well for it to be fair. Kind regards We will soon provide a complete solution for Project 1 because of its valuable learning. Alright, @Carlton. No problem at all, and thank you for your response. I just wanted to bring a small limitation in my project’s LLM function to your attention, which I discovered after submission. It may impact one or two tasks. However, no concerns—this has been a great learning experience. And if possible, just add one line in your Evaluation LLM prompt: “Give loose marking for effort!”—because, you know, creativity deserves some extra credit! I am not able to see my project marks please look into the problem Its not been evaluated yet. We are still processing them. Kind regards So will the solution be based on New MCP style or will they use the same function calling? Definitely MCP style. Its the most elegant solution and it works beautifully. As soon as evals are done we will showcase it. @carlton Any ETA on project 1 scores? I would like to request some bonus like 0.5 bonus mark for each day of delay from the original expected date of receiving score for Project 1 (will be life-saving for us and will be an incentive for team to release scores quickly; or request to TAs if you had better ideas for helping us score more in Project 1)!

What was discussed in that live session regarding docker: Search for existing containers on repositories such as dockerhub. Pull an existing docker image. Run that image inside a container. Enter to that container and modify something(such as installing python inside a ubuntu container, for customization or create some file) Once done you can commit it. And push customized container’s image to docker hub. Regarding local models running for project1, it’s a good idea, we will see if it’s possible to discuss in session.",

Maybe Download Deepseek 70b or even 671b and create an api while y’all run the model locally, in the long it would be cheaper for the course? because the model doesn’t know basic commands after telling how to do it.

For task A1, I am automating my server to remove the /data directory that’s already present and run datagen.py again. Is this fine? For /read endpoint, is there a standard for parameters like “path=/data/format.md” or the parameter could be a plain english sentence like “path=show the data in format.md”? Are we concerned about what’s shown on the console if I run a /run command as long as it gets the job done? For tasks A1-10, are the file paths provided in the project doc standard or even they’re flexible? Ex. “Count the number of Wednesdays in file /data/format.md, and write just the number to /data/out.txt”",

          "content": "Hi Andrew, You have done a great job with the Phase A tasks. Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy. I just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application. In other words getting 10/10 in evaluate.py does NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10 or 1/10 in the real evaluation. So do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of evaluate.py. It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general idea of the task. That said, evaluate.py is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application). Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty). Hope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.) A word of caution: (i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation) Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task (possibly your first task) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.

Hence executing code Interpreter tools failed as the model gave outdated code. I have raised this issue before Hence i moved to function calling, using local llms as cost-effective solution and it was quite robust. I just need to understand how the function should be general, maybe 2-3 tasks you could provide the general description along with all the ways one would query the agent llm(ie our project). This general function is what i need help with. Please kindly do the needful.",

Raising it for you means raising it for everyone. $1 for everyone equals raising it by $1600+ (i.e Rs 1.39 Lakhs) for us! The budget question then involves more than one person. It also involves the BS Team Operations and not just the TDS team and therefore instead of responding with a response that is not useful, we typically try to solve the problem first and then respond. In short we are working on it. But as we have mentioned repeatedly in our sessions, use APIs efficiently, thats part of the skill. As soon as we have a resolution we will inform everyone via an announcement and an email. Kind regards",

You need to download both evaluate.py and datagen.py in same folder and then execute evaluate.py using uv. uv run evaluate.py --email $any_email. For phase B Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025] Tools in Data Science Output specifications will be detailed in the “task” sent to the endpoint. Phase B is meant to be vague because if you can solve it, without an elaborate and gratuitous use of gpt function calling, then you can actually solve all tasks using the same function !

I assume you have already achieved your answers, but I want to clarify this for someone who is facing this problem. The thing is GPT-4o-mini is intelligent enough to understand what kind of task you are asking it do, and extracting Credit Card info from an image is one of the many prohibited tasks. What you can do is, try to fool it using itself. Just ask ChatGPT to generate a prompt that would be capable of fooling itself into extracting out that credit card info. I was capable of doing it after pretending to be a working on a Cyber Security project, and other fake details which ChatGPT itself provided me with.",

Another Fix: try using a virtual environment which is highly suggested since there is no chance for you to interfere with the system packages. create a venv using python3 -m venv name_of_venv add this line to your .bashrc in ~ folder as source /path/to/your/venv/location and run source .bashrc. This time no error occurs as you do everything in your virtual environment you can install anything python3 package using pip3 install package name.

Every time I send a POST request to: bash Copy https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings I receive a 401 Unauthorized response. This, in turn, causes my code to fail with a KeyError: 'data' because the expected JSON response doesn’t include the \"data\" key. What I’ve Tried Token Verification: I’m using the AIPROXY_TOKEN obtained by logging in at aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev with my IITM email. The token is passed in the header as follows: python Copy \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {AIPROXY_TOKEN}\" I added debug prints to confirm that the token is being used correctly (printing the first few characters). API Request Details: The request includes the correct Content-Type: application/json header. The payload is set as: json Copy {\"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": [\"Test\"]} Despite this, the response status is consistently 401 Unauthorized. Debug Output: Here’s a snippet of the debug output: bash Copy HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings \"HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\" 🔴 A9 failed: 'data' This confirms that the issue is with the authentication rather than our processing logic. What I Suspect The token may be invalid, expired, or misconfigured. There could be changes in the token permissions or endpoint requirements that I’m not aware of. Alternatively, there might be an issue on the server side with token validation. Request for Help Has anyone else encountered this issue recently? Could someone verify if there are any changes to the authentication requirements for the embeddings endpoint? Any insights or updated instructions on how to ensure the token is valid and has the proper permissions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your assistance!",

This is as per the instructions provided here. But this gave me the following error: Error: short-name \"freshbash/dataworks-agent\" did not resolve to an alias and no unqualified-search registries are defined in \"/etc/containers/registries.conf The above is the format in which we have to provide the image name in the Google form. So, I was confused whether this would succeed during actual evaluation. The only way its working right now is when I specify the image name to be docker.io/freshbash/dataworks-agent I’m not yet very good with how containers work so some insights would be very helpful.

I was able to develop an application using this approach; however, due to submission time constraints, I could not verify all tasks (my bad). While I tested some tasks and found the results to be highly accurate, I was unable to validate everything thoroughly. Therefore, I submitted the function-calling approach (Method 2) instead. I sincerely appreciate everyone’s guidance and support.",

I have poured my heart and soul into this project, dedicating countless hours and sleepless nights to ensure its success. The project has successfully passed both Test A and Test B, and I was thrilled to see my hard work paying off. However, this single error has left me devastated. I am pleading with you, with all my heart, to allow me to correct this mistake by updating the Docker image link. Alternatively, I humbly request that my application be reviewed directly through GitHub. Please consider this an exception, as I have worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to create an application that is 890 lines long. I beg for your understanding and leniency in this matter. This project means the world to me, and I am genuinely sobbing over this setback. Thank you for considering my heartfelt request. Sincerely, Rishit Jain (24F2004595)",

Can someone please clarify if it shall be graded still? @carlton @Jivraj image1340×527 17.9 KB image1002×560 51.4 KB @Muthupalaniappan It is saying you did not attempt it because you did not answer the seek portal question. You are not graded on the seek portal question. It only exists to make sure you saw the GA and attempted it. You are only graded on your submission of GA1 on the actual assignment page where your last saved submission is used for grading. Kind regards Dear Sir, I encountered the same issue as mentioned. Could you please confirm whether GA 1 will still be evaluated under this condition, and if we will receive our actual score based on the last saved submission on the assignment page? sir can you please allow us to submit it . like open the seek portal for a few mins . because we have worked hard to finished the assignment and all our hardwork will be in vain … please carlton: You are only graded on your submission of GA1 on the actual assignment page where your last saved submission is used for grading. @Venkatesh_2k01 @21f3000599 Please refer to above reply Hello, I accessed the assignment through the provided link and attempted and saved it. But unfortunately I forgot to submit it on my course LMS. I have put in a lot of effort to complete this and I scored 9, so I kindly request you to consider it and provide your clarification on the matter. Respected Sir, I made the similar mistake of not selecting a yes on the seek IITM portal According to your previous replies, does it imply that only the answers submitted through the link provided will be considered for evaluation regardless of the seek portal selection for this time? Thanks @23f2005471 Correct! Only scores that were saved in your actual last submission on the ga page itself will be evaluated (the portal question is just to make sure you were aware of the GA and confirm that you attempted it). Kind regards Respected Sir/Madam, I have submitted the TDS GA 1 assignment but failed to submit the Yes or NO option in the checkbox I request you to please consider my submission as I have scored 6/10 marks in the assignment and if you won’t my whole efforts will be lost just because of this image1463×795 64.3 KB carlton: You are not graded on the seek portal question.

      "content": "Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects. Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical? That said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I’d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently. Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments: Isolation – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects. Reproducibility – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies. Portability – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering. Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name) • Good for quick experimentation and testing. • Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time. Using requirements.txt • Best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. • Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup. Specifying Versions in requirements.txt • If you don’t specify a version, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes. • If you do specify a version (package==1.2.3), you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues. Handling Version Conflicts • If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall. • Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider: • Using greater than/less than constraints: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes). • Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment. Best Practices Summary Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda). Use a requirements.txt file for reproducibility. Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed. Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages. Kind regards For some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it’s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions. Whereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine. For project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement 24f2006531: Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? Coming to your second question, The first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s project it’s better to use requirements.txt. 24f2006531: My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation The creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed. Never try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that, pip3 freeze > requirements.txt . This does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you Thank you sir for clarifying. carlton: • Using greater than/less than constraints: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes). I wasn’t aware of greater than/less than constraint. This would definitely address the error I mentioned in my question.",

The new error message will be clearer, like this: Error: At [0].rating: Values don't match. Expected: \"7.4\". Actual: 7.4 FYI, we expect all values as strings, not numbers.

How to handle the error ? @Jivraj Error: At 2025-02-05: Values don’t match There is no submit button is available in below screen. Is it fine to save the link url only. Please clarify (unless we click submit button the log of Graded Assignment 4 remains red) image1920×1080 337 KB I have a doubt regarding the bonus mark. Suppose someone were to get 10/10 in the assignment, would their mark be recored as 11/10 or just 10? (Assuming they have interacted in this thread) Anyone scoring 10/10 on GA4 and replying with a relevant message on this thread will get 11/10 For me I just made filter of rating between 2 and 7 in site and typed in console as per video. with that data got in console worked fine. copy the coding and save in place use it for data extract when finally submit For question 2 getting Error: At [8].title: Values don’t match. Expected: “9. Un matrimonio di troppo”. Actual: “9. You’re Cordially Invited” But this movie is not found when searched by name image1414×295 19 KB how to get the BBC weather API key? Just a quick query on the Bonus mark. Would this be added to the final grade? Say for example, Someone get a full score in the first 4 assignments. So the total comes up to 39.5/39.5, and would be converted to 0.15 or 15 marks. Would the bonus mark be additional to that 15 or would the score change to 40.5/39.5 and then get normalised to 15? @JoelJeffrey It will be added to the GA4 marks, not the final grade. So, it’s roughly worth 0.15% on the total - not a full 1% on the total. you can go and login using your email id in this below mentioned link https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys Error: At [10].year: Values don’t match.

Try again. @Jivraj @carlton can you please explain the reason for this error Hi Mishkat Please refer to this post. GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025] Tools in Data Science @JoelJeffrey We will be changing this question. Even we found it pretty hard Kind regards Kind regards @s.anand Sir the question 10 of the Graded Assignment 4 is very tough I have tried everything from custom python codes using different libraries to online converted and also formatted using prettier. Please sir guide me how to do the question. Yep figured that, and after matching the data solved the error and got that question correct. Though thank you. @s.anand Sir I have done the question 2 of the graded assignment but I am very curious to know why the answers language gets periodically change. Is there some kind of backend code which is responsible for that or is something else ? Yes we’ll were facing this issue. @carlton sir mentioned yesterday that they will change the question. \"We will be changing this question. Even we found it hard Kind regards\" So need to worry about that question for now. OK, that is good to hear, you won’t believe that yesterday I was trying this question for 2 hours literally, it can be more also. I was stuck at that question for 2 days, I tried multiple ways but was not able to format the content with prettier as expected, every time I was getting the error “Incorrect. Try again.” On popular demand, I’ve made Q10 of GA4 easier (converting from PDF to Markdown). The question remains the same, but the check is more liberal and the error messages are more helpful. Please give it a shot now. (FYI, one person did solve it. A colleague, not someone from the IITM DS program.) Hello Sir, i tried but unfortunately after extracting the contents and formatting the contents and submitting it, it’s showing various errors like Missing links, Missing tables… But on checking the file i wasn’t able to find any single table in the contents in that case what could be done to fix these errors? @Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini same issue with me as well Sir I checked the pdf file, there is only one place unorder list is given and the same is available in my answer. But the system throws error Missing List (I tried with other symbols * and + also) . Please inform me where I made mistake image1108×271 5.87 KB this is table.

I checked in the pdf file also, the blue color text seems a link but its not clickable. Any suggestion to move nearer to the actual solution. You may try like this: cresco vomito [cresco vomito](;;;) Even I’m getting a similar error in Q2, it is expecting a foreign title whereas my search result gives only English titles. image1614×250 14.4 KB Please help. I think the idea behind this font is to make it difficult for people to manually work on the markdown file from scratch. I guess they want us to use the tools (like PyMuPDF4LLM, markitdown) they provided as resources to convert pdf into a markdown and then may be we can do some manual intervention to make it to the result as the scraping tools are not 100% accurate. Could be another reason too. TAs’ can feel free to pitch in. A post was merged into an existing topic: Tds: assignment is not submitting your last saved score (i.e.6 of your’s) will be official score and forgot about seek portal , it is not meant for this type of assignment. Thank you for the update! I gave Q10 another shot, and I was able to solve it this time. The more liberal checks and improved error messages made a big difference in understanding where I was going wrong. Thank again. Can we use hacking to get answers to some questions?

For example, The Recruit is also known as Graymail in India. My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles. Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated? Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect.

The current example on the portal is: image1580×196 4.81 KB Your dot of 2.9 may be the dot from alphabet or numeric one Try to copy the value and then replace it Try to copy the error data The problem might be off dot check one dot is on right of m and other right of 0 in keyboard these two dots may represent different meanings is it resolved? i too am getting the same error,even if it was working fine yesterday. https will be part of the link (provided ‘link’ is one of the checkpoints of evaluation) Sir, In Graded Assignment - 4 >> Q2, the year I extracted appears as “2024,” whereas the expected value on the portal is “2024–”. I have manually adjusted several values based on the expected format. This issue is specific to the year field. I use different classes to extract values for various fields. Could there be any other element on the portal affecting this extraction? In Q4, one of my classmates is encountering a “root property” error despite using the same extraction method as I do. Upon checking, I found that this issue occurs because the city’s time is displayed as the previous day compared to our time. The portal results seem to be based on the city’s actual time rather than IST. I would appreciate your guidance on these issues. Good idea @23f2005138 and thanks. I fixed this. The example now reads: [ { \"id\": \"tt1234567\", \"title\": \"Movie 1\", \"year\": \"2021\", \"rating\": \"5.8\" }, { \"id\": \"tt7654321\", \"title\": \"Movie 2\", \"year\": \"2019\", \"rating\": \"6.2\" }, … with the year and ratings quoted. lakshaygarg654: In Graded Assignment - 4 >> Q2, the year I extracted appears as “2024,” whereas the expected value on the portal is “2024–”. I have manually adjusted several values based on the expected format. This issue is specific to the year field. I guess for the year part, there are certain series having multiple seasons, for which hyphenated “years” are given. For the particular instance - “2024–”, it appears another season/part is announced, thats why it is written that way. Thanks @21f2000709 for this information. I figure out where i made mistake. During writing console code I added to remove non numeric values in year field which i guess removed that hyphen (“–”). I will rectify that.

Please refer the instruction. 10000952401080×183 43.8 KB you can manually add space after the hyphen I face the same error, also thinking of issueDate, the value seems to be constant in every loop inside forecasts array (is it because the data is issed on that particular date) that gives same issue date key across the json outcome. Anyways the new json with same issueDate also gives the same Root error Double-check that the rating field in the JSON is indeed a float (2.9) and not a string (\"2.9\") in your code. That is perhaps to ensure we don’t manually write the markdown for the pdf. Converting the pdf to markdown and getting the correct output is extremely hard, I tried doing that multiple times yet wasn’t able to get that right by the original method. But since it is mentioned that the GAA is hackable and we are allowed to do so, for some of the questions, therefore you can try solving that by establishing a breakpoint in the sources and then write the code in the console to get the expected output.

Yes …due to the location difference the search results are different for everyone therefore you need to adjust it accordingly It might need around 6-7 amendments The API is returning 14 days of forecast data, as evidenced by the output However, the issueDate values are not unique for each day. Instead, they represent the time when the forecast was issued or updated. In your output, there are only two unique issueDate values: 2025-02-08T04:00:00-05:00 2025-02-08T16:01:58-05:00 This means the forecast was updated twice on February 8, 2025, once at 04:00 AM and again at 4:01 PM (both in EST timezone) …To get a unique weather description for each day, you need to modify your approach by using the actual forecast day for each day instead.

His issue is genuine. Arnav’s JSON seems to be correct, yet these are some issues faced by him. Yeah! even I am facing this issue. Despite lot of efforts, last question markdown seems to always incorrect. It is always throwing any sort of error for no reason. The IMDB and weather questions was a pain along with the 10th question, wasted so much time @s.anand , the questions were nowhere tough, it was the problems with the evaluation part i had spend hours just to sit and correct the JSON file and no comments on the 10th question’s part. I am fine with the academia being challenging to study not the evalation making me manually edit solutions @Jivraj @carlton yes change manually, there are slight changes which we have to do For the 8th question, i am getting an error that tells me i have not run the action, though i manually triggered it and confirmed the commit was made. Cant figure out whats wrong. for second query i am getting this result as row 4 and 5 (Screenshot)… but when testing the results it shows {\"id\":\"tt22804850\",\"title\":\"3.

Just want to appreciate the course and your efforts towards this. We need more “teachers” like you, who really puts an extra effort in the course. And i have never seen any course cool as this, like appreciating tweaking things, using dev console to tweak things, keep the code checks on client side (and as S Anand’s Student i have leveraged that freedom , gave client side answer checks’s code to o1 and it reverse engineered the minifed code, and lots of question were solved by that only, but really curious on how others are doing this) keeping the cutting edge tech in course, like function calling from OpenAI. ( i have seen some students solutions, they were using regex to solve that problem ) image1483×687 48.1 KB why everytime question 2 answer is showing error in json? What error are you getting @Abhay222 ? Can you post a screenshot or error details ? Is it safe to skip Q4 for those who got the city named Nur-Sultan, since it has been renamed to Astana, and the answer for Astana is incorrect in the portal? @s.anand There is possibly wrong evaluation in q6 as it is taking in 2nd latest link as the correct answer. I might be wrong, but the latest one is giving me incorrect evaluation while the 2nd latest is giving me the correct score. getting the same issue Error: At [12].year: Values don’t match.

Difference ? your value does have a - and a space at the end. reason ? you might be scraping it ? trim() or maybe using innerText to get tag’s text ? it seems we are intended to provide country specific versions for Individual students simulating being an analyst for MNC in various locations. Clearly you got Spain and I seem to have gotten France, although it doesn’t seem to be mentioned in the question itself. Thank you Tanya for pointing out this issue.

Alright so in Q4 of W4, We have to extract weather forecast data from bbc servers for a given city. The city I have been given Nur-Sultan is not present in the bbc data base, it appears the city is now known as Astana and is listed in the bbc database as Astana.

Thankyou , but now i am getting missing code error. What it means? @23f2000573 You just have to add a space after a hyphen Check if you are using table formating where there is a table, also there is perhaps a code block in the pdf where a small section of text is in different font than the rest. No there is no code block in the pdf. Now i m getting missing code error. Why this error can arise @Saransh_Saini I am also facing the same error in this question the answer format is correct the link is probably not the latest one, I had the same issue because my code was working only for the first 100 entries… you should try paginating your code so it can cover more entries just change the values as itis coming in the error change the name manually as the name is diiferent on imdb according to the region, I had the same issue… are you able do it now? Reload and check yes facing the same thing you are missing code block Normal : print(123) Code Block : print(123) you can refer to week 2 q1 for the syntax of code block Screenshot 2025-02-09 2340281910×314 56.7 KB anyone have idea about this error? image1757×367 48.3 KB getting this error Yes thankyou i noticed that code block.

Hi Satish, Your last submitted score is the only valid score. You have to check before submitting that the score is correct. There is a reload button to load previous answers. But some answers require a live service. If the live service is not running at the time of the check (when you hit the submit button), you will not be scored for those questions. Please make sure that you have any live services running when the submit button is used and check that the last saved score is correct. Kind regards",

Key concepts, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies, are not explained in a structured manner, making it difficult for students to follow. @carlton sir i watch live session recording , but still not getting some useful from it , I am talking about week 3 content in llm , these words are never heard by us so please try to tech from basic things please . At least tell us , what is llm and what is use of , everything is going to above of our head . Hi Hari, The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended. Have you watched this session in particular? If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student. Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding. Kind regards",

How many units of Bike were sold in Jakarta on transactions with at least 163 units? Same for me . I am also getting error of the answer i am getting from OpenRefine Sir please check Q 5,8,9 also @s.anand @carlton I have tried every method for the 5th question even brute force still I am getting same answer but it is saying incorrect. @carlton i am also not able to do que 5th question … Any hint Respected @carlton I am facing an issue with GA5 Q5, as my answer is being marked incorrect despite multiple attempts. I have processed data at OpenRefine . To ensure accuracy, I also tried a manual approach by converting the JSON file to Excel and filtering the data, but I arrived at the same answer each time. However, the assignment portal still shows it as incorrect. Sir Could you please check portal expected answer for this question. Thankyou @carlton Respected sir, I have tried the 5 th question n no. of times but getting error as incorrect answer can i get any guidance on this please. Thankyou @jivraj , @carlton, @s.anand q5 give same answer which i am getting is incorrect. but i tried manually, python and openrefine, excel everything gives the same answer. please look into it. We have noted this issue and are looking into it. In Question 8 I am getting this error Please tell me how do i tackle this errror Error: At root: Array length mismatch thanku sir also q6 i got 52747 after cleaning the json and trying to extract using all methods 96 lines where reconstructed. but portal keep saying wrong for evry answer.pls check on this also Q5 I tried with openfire and python script , both are giving me same answer but its not accepted please check . Also in task the ask is to identify \" Top-Performing City: Determine which city has the highest total unit sales for the selected product and report the unit sales number.\" but on top of input box question is different “How many units of Table were sold in Mexico City on transactions with at least 159 units?” i think there is some bug in Q 1… it shows correct if in percentage I pass comma instead of decimal. kindly check. secondly by multiple logics i checked q 5 & Q 6… but it shows incorrect only.

How many units of Bacon were sold in Beijing on transactions with at least 28 units? image1987×1637 255 KB I am getting this error when trying to generate API key… Who I need to connect to allow me generate a key on my iitm email id Hi @Algsoch I have checked your dataset along with your params, and its perfectly correct. Try again and check your step. Otherwise go and watch 18-Feb Live Session @Saransh_Saini Q5 fixed, thanks for fixing the issue. Now we are struggling with Q8. MY q8 is : Write a DuckDB SQL query to find all posts IDs after 2025-01-09T12:36:14.085Z with at least 1 comment with 4 useful stars, sorted. The result should be a table with a single column called post_id , and the relevant post IDs should be sorted in ascending order. when i use below query, i get some some result, a table of post_id but error : Error: At root: Array length mismatch Reason: below query checking only 1st comment ($[0] refers to the first comment in the array) we have to check all comments not 1st. But when i change the query to check any one comment its giving different types of error. WITH filtered_posts AS ( SELECT post_id FROM social_media WHERE timestamp >= '2025-01-09T09:48:01.303Z' AND EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM social_media AS sm WHERE json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') IS NOT NULL AND CAST(json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') AS INTEGER) > 4 ) ) SELECT post_id FROM filtered_posts ORDER BY post_id ASC; Kindly check if any issue with Q8. May be my query is wrong or may be not. Thankyou @lakshaygarg654 Your query construction is unnecessarily complicated and therefore will be difficult to debug. Query construction is best done by thinking what you want at the end. In this case its an ordered post_id So thats where you begin: SELECT post_id FROM ( ... ) ORDER BY post_id Doing this, produces the actual result without giving the logic yet. Then at each stage you add the next stage of complexity. You will still need the post_id for the outermost layer so you have to continue extracting it from the inner layers of the nested query. ... ... FROM ( SELECT post_id, ( ... ) as max_stars FROM social_media WHERE time_stamp >= (whatever the parameter you have been given) AND max_stars >= (whatever the parameter for min stars you have been given) ) ... ... Then the final layer of the nest ... ... ( ) as max_stars ... ... You are not expecting me to solve the whole question right? (Hint: the inner most extraction involves JSON or “structure” extraction, which is a powerful capability) But I hope you understand the logic of SQL which is a very elegant set theory language which is why it has lasted for over 4 decades. Think clearly at each stage what do you need. Start with the answer and work backwards, extracting at each stage the logical items you require for the outer layer to be functional. Kind regards Its been done. You will get a more detailed error now. And we have relaxed the number of errors allowed (it actually did have a tolerance limit but it was fairly tight) sir even after applying this logic im getting error at root: array length mismatch @daksh76 thats because your innermost logic layer must not return a long list of results. If you think about it logically each row cannot have a column field where one of the columns is a whole row of results right? Thats why you are getting the error. Check your innermost layer is returning a single value or a row of results. Kind regards Thank you for your response @carlton. You are absolutely right—my query was unnecessarily complex. Initially, I attempted a simpler approach, using various JSON extraction functions. However, I encountered multiple errors, including: json_extract: “Table Function with name ‘json_extract’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.” json_each: “Table Function with name ‘json_each’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.” json_extract_path_text: “Table Function with name ‘json_extract_path_text’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.” Since the simple approach did not work, I attempted a more complex query to achieve the desired result. However, that too did not yield the expected output. To gain better insight, I extracted ten values into a table using the console and then reconstructed the query accordingly. Unfortunately, I am still facing issues related to functions not being recognized in the catalog. I would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue. I do not need the exact answer; I just want to know if there is any issue with the portal for Q8. Thankyou @lakshaygarg654 This might help DuckDB Unnesting Examples Unnest a list, generating 3 rows (1, 2, 3): SELECT unnest([1, 2, 3]); Unnesting a struct, generating two columns (a, b): SELECT unnest({'a': 42, 'b': 84}); Recursive unnest of a list of structs: SELECT unnest([{'a': 42, 'b': 84}, {'a': 100,... Kind regards lakshaygarg654: I just want to know if there is any issue with the portal for Q8. Nope no issues with portal for Q8 Thanks @carlton I found the correct query. I am still getting the answer as incorrect, though the answer for my dataset : 1187 (951+236) is correct.

Finally returns all the post_id’s in ascending order. But it’s giving me an Array length mismatch error. I’m stuck here. Any hints would be helpful. @Jivraj @carlton P.S.

This way of teaching is actually amazing as it will make us remember for long. Fortunate to be a part of this course! Thanks to the team Yes … For u … u fixed it??? No I couldn’t fix it That question is same for me. QUESTION 9 I was supposed to transcribe the audio of the provided video for a certain time period. After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds. Here was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed. In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.” The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice. Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind. From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations. Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \" Can anyone provide solution of question 5 related to duckdb module please is there anyway to practice the assignments and check answers even though the deadline for the assignment passes? or is the answer given somewhere just for learning sake.

Query construction is best done by thinking what you want at the end. In this case its an ordered post_id So thats where you begin: SELECT post_id FROM ( ... ) ORDER BY post_id Doing this, produces the actual result without giving the logic yet. Then at each stage you add the next stage of complexity. You will still need the post_id for the outermost layer so you have to continue extracting it from the inner layers of the nested query. ... ... FROM ( SELECT post_id, ( ... ) as max_stars FROM social_media WHERE time_stamp >= (whatever the parameter you have been given) AND max_stars >= (whatever the parameter for min stars you have been given) ) ... ... Then the final layer of the nest ... ... ( ) as max_stars ... ... You are not expecting me to solve the whole question right? (Hint: the inner most extraction involves JSON or “structure” extraction, which is a powerful capability) But I hope you understand the logic of SQL which is a very elegant set theory language which is why it has lasted for over 4 decades. Think clearly at each stage what do you need. Start with the answer and work backwards, extracting at each stage the logical items you require for the outer layer to be functional. Kind regards",

Initially, I attempted a simpler approach, using various JSON extraction functions.

A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.” json_each: “Table Function with name ‘json_each’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.” json_extract_path_text: “Table Function with name ‘json_extract_path_text’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.” Since the simple approach did not work, I attempted a more complex query to achieve the desired result. However, that too did not yield the expected output. To gain better insight, I extracted ten values into a table using the console and then reconstructed the query accordingly. Unfortunately, I am still facing issues related to functions not being recognized in the catalog. I would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue.

Finally returns all the post_id’s in ascending order. But it’s giving me an Array length mismatch error. I’m stuck here. Any hints would be helpful. @Jivraj @carlton P.S.

I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds. Here was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed. In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.” The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice. Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind. From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations. Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"",

Thakur Vishalkumar Vinod 23f2004320 Screenshot 2025-02-18 1824011574×450 32.2 KB Screenshot 2025-02-18 1824461866×668 130 KB @23f2004320 I have checked the backend server. The actual score is 85 in Module 1. Ignore seek portal, because scores are evaluated externally on our server. Those scores on seek portal are just from the placeholder question that asked whether you saw GA1 and attempted it. It has no bearing on your actual marks. The actual score will be in the dashboard soon. Kind regards. Sir for the GA3 the saved score says its 4.5, total is 9.5 so my total should be 47.4. @23f1002223 Screenshot 2025-02-20 at 7.52.54 am2622×274 23.1 KB According to your submission history your last submission before the deadline was 3.5 (i.e. your score would be 36.8 out of 100) Kind regards @carlton, the error has been rectified, and the corrected mark has now been accurately reflected in the system. w2tdse1100×886 50.3 KB Sorry for the late upload but as you can see in the screenshot i had submitted answers for TDS Week 2 graded assignment but it shows 0 both here and in current courses tab. I did reload the recent tab before uploading and for tds ga submission i submit and keep the tab open until the timer runs out. @shubham6 I have checked the backend server. It does show your score as 8 for GA2, so we have the correct score for you. Can you send me a screenshot of your dashboard (where your course cards are) thanks. Kind regards",

      "content": "Hello @carlton and @Jivraj and @s.anand sir It is becoming quite evident that a lot of us will struggle to get something decent out for the project-1 by saturday and we are struggling here. I request to reconsider the deadline and extend the due date so that it gives slightly more odds of submitting the project. Thanks Vikram @carlton @s.anand Yes Sir please extend the project deadline. yes, it is quite difficult and also the people who have done this course in previous terms are able to help just because of the difficulty. please extend the deadline or give out some resources. Yes @s.anand , @carlton , The project is complex, and an extension would really help reduce our stress and let us submit better work. Additionally, some extra help sessions would be really helpful to clarify our doubts. @carlton @s.anand yes sir please extend the project deadline. Sir please extend the deadline it’s really hard to do we need more time Yes, it’s too hectic to balance work and this project @carlton @s.anand sir plss extend deadline as it is taking too much time to understand the project and this is completely new for us, we are trying our best but couldn’t able to make it. Some days extension might reduce our stress and we’ll perform better in the project as this is very important for us. @carlton @s.anand sir pls extend the deadline as the GATE DA exam is also scheduled on Saturday Please extend the deadline @s.anand @carlton sir pls extend the deadline of project1 as it’s very difficult, we are spending so much of time still not able to complete the project and the gate exam is also on 15 February. We would be grateful if the deadline could be extended… Please at least make it 16 or 17 Feb. The GATE DA exam and project deadline coinciding has already hampered progress on both ends. At least the project will be much better even with the smallest possible extension. Kindly consider the request and extend the deadline sir. It would be really helpful as we could atleast work upto our full potential and submit few tasks increasing the odds of our submission. @carlton @s.anand Indeed, even i am stuck in project parts and a lot of them. EXTEND !!! Kindly consider our request to extend the deadline, as many students have their GATE exam on Saturday. A slight extension would be greatly helpful. SIr please extend the deadline of project 1 give us 2 to 3 days it was helpful for us. @22f1000376 @22f3000276 @23f2004636 @23f2004563 @sharik4real @Mystic_9803 @Rishabh2 @23f1002279 @varun_parashar @22f2001175 and others… I have discussed this with the rest of the TDS team and with Operations on multiple occasions (including today.) Here are the highlights of the discussion: We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday. All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago) Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago) We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it. All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students: Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed. Please make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements. Kind regards TDS Team -Yes sir this project 1 is very tough for even 1 question a whole day is used. @carlton @s.anand Sir besides this project we have other subject graded assignments and MLP Project and MAD2 project. Please sir it would be very beneficial for everyone, we have talked to other students also we are not able to even complete the 10 A tasks even with the evaluate.py rest aside Task B. Please sir take this into consideration. We are trying very hard for this project even you can see students asking various questions in the discourse, we are struggling but still sir we are trying. @carlton @Jivraj @s.anand We truly appreciate the efforts being put by the TDS team, but not to be rude here - Why is Project 1 deadline is on Saturday and not on Sunday, as many of us are doing the course not as a full-time student. (Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated. Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week. Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here. Thank you. sir…please extend the deadline… @carlton @s.anand Yes Sir, Please extend the deadline Hi Instructor team, Thank you for your response. Till week4, I have completed all my assignments using internet/gpt without fully understanding the concepts. I wondered how is it going to benefit me in the real world scenario. That said, now I am facing that situation in the name of Project1. No real learning till week4 but a project to complete now. Yes, Please extend the deadline Please extend deadline for project. Sir, its a genuine request please extend the deadline Sir, I would like to inquire if it would be possible to reconsider the weightage of the projects. As many students are finding it challenging to achieve high score in Project 1 and have been requesting an extension for the deadline. Instead of extending the deadline, I propose adjusting the weightage, allocating 15% to Project 1 and 25% to Project 2. This adjustment seems fair, as Project 2 requires students to build upon the concepts used in Project 1. By making this change, it would provide additional time for improvement and potentially help those who struggled with the first project to to get good scores, without disadvantaging those who performed well initially. Would it be possible to implement this change?",

Here are the highlights of the discussion: We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday. All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago) Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago) We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it. All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students: Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed. Please make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements. Kind regards TDS Team",

(Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated. Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week. Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here. Thank you.",

And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py Inside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile which then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder. So the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully): You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000 You create a docker image that runs this application server. You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page. For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files: evaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts. Run evalute.py using uv. If your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task. Hope that gives clarity. Kind regards",

Thank you Satvik Sawhney 23f2003680 So the reason for the failure is: You had initially put your Dockerfile inside a directory called TDSP-1-main instead of being directly in your repo. (On 15th Feb 1:26AM) Then when our automated script checked if students repos met the requirements and yours did not we immediately sent out a warning email as a opportunity for students to make the necessary corrections. Then once you realised your mistake, on Feb 17th at 9:11 pm IST i.e yesteday, you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations. Then you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=“21f3002647, post:1, topic:167471”] image250×534 3.92 KB [/quote] showing that your files are in the correct place. We do not take into consideration modifications to your repo after the deadline because then we would have to extend that curtesy to all students. Kind regards @carlton sir Yes, I corrected my repo at 9:11 PM IST, but I had actually written and submitted my query much earlier at 4 PM. At that time, I wasn’t entirely sure if this was the actual issue, but it looks like it was. I understand that the deadline had already passed, and I only saw the email later. I had two GATE papers on the 15th and an interview on the 16th, so I was extremely busy and couldn’t check my emails sooner. However, I had raised my concern well before making the correction, so I’d really appreciate it if my submission could still be considered Kind regards, Arnav Mehta 21f3002647 Sir, please consider it we have spent a lot of time, in my case just the d in Dockerfile was small that too on remote repository. On my local repository it was Dockerfile only I even have a published docker image as verified by you autated script only. The name of the file on remote repository did not change even after commit it through my local repo, once I read the mail in morning it was only then I realised it wasn’t changed on GitHub repo. Sir I understand the deadline has passed and I am not asking for a resubmission, I am just asking to consider the already submitted work, just that. It would be really helpful. I just have one commit on my repo that too “Rename dockerfile to Dokerfile” . Sir please attest consider what we have already submitted. I have made no changes as you can verify it too. Sir it is a humble request to please consider it. Warm Regards, Satvik Sawhney 23f2003680 Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 1.53.10 PM1889×467 54 KB",

Thanks! @carlton @s.anand code to take reference from: import gzip import pandas as pd from datetime import datetime log_path = 's-anand.net-May-2024.gz' start_time = datetime.strptime('01:00:00', '%H:%M:%S').time() end_time = datetime.strptime('15:00:00', '%H:%M:%S').time() log_data = [] def parse_log(line): parts = line.split(' ') log_time = datetime.strptime(parts[3][1:], '%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S') method, url, status = parts[5][1:], parts[6], int(parts[8]) return log_time, method, url, status with gzip.open(log_path, 'rt') as file: for entry in file: log_time, method, url, status = parse_log(entry) if method == 'GET' and url.startswith('/blog/') and 200 <= status < 300: if log_time.weekday() == 0 and start_time <= log_time.time() < end_time: log_data.append(entry) print(f\"Successful GET requests: {len(log_data)}\") ps: I shared code after the deadline hopefully no issues there! I’m also facing same kind of issue in Q3, GA5, while cross checked answer from different methods getting same result 1603, which is showing incorrect. Kindly check this issue. Thanks The same issue is being faced by many students, not only for this condition, but others as well. Please look into it actually i got 130 as answer. but the answer accepted by the portal was 129. i felt like, i have to change one or two numbers front and back, i tried the same before. it worked For the same question? But it shouldnt be +1 -1 to get the correct answer right. Hi @muskan2431 we are running some checks. Please bear with us, Kind regards We have determined that some students were affected by GA5 Q3. Whoever we have identified as having received the incorrect assessment will receive 1 mark for that particular question. These are the students that we have identified as been assessed incorrectly: SN Email 1 21f1000131@ds.study.iitm.ac.in 2 21f1001484@ds.study.iitm.ac.in 3 21f1001631@ds.study.iitm.ac.in 4

After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds. Here was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed. In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.” The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice. Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind. From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations. Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \" i downloaded mp3, trimmed the video using ffmpeg and used this Convert your MP3 to Text for Free Online, it worked",

Syllabus kindly hint us on the type of questions, kind of tools to practice I did my ROE the last term, the time was not enough for me. I would like to know if it is actually possible to solve all the questions within the time Any mock or resource to practice from? additional tips, if any Modules 1 - 5 Questions will be similar to GAs and the content in the modules. ROE is quite hard. Only a small number will be able to do it in the given time frame. We will have some past ROEs as practise … watch sessions Kind regards Thanks for the answer @carlton Is it safe to assume that ROE is nothing but a “GA with extremely short deadline” since we don’t have proctors ? Or is the ROE more complex structured ? P.S. I am not saying the questions will be hard or easy, just asking about structure. Sir questions will be of Numeeical type or MCQs type as in earlier batches it was MCQs?? ROEs are always unique. They can be of any kind. We do not fix one method. Therefore its not possible to say what kind of questions will be there whether MCQ, MSQ or numerical or text etc. Kind regards The ROEs are not GAs with short deadlines. A GA question usually tests one concept in isolation. ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short time). If your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you… past experience shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome without significant assistance from the “hooomann” So practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard. There will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test. Kind regards Is there scope for collaboration in a 45 minute test? Depends on the collaborators and how they split up the tasks. If its a team that knows their roles and a team leader that can designate tasks correctly then quite possibly. In practise though that rarely happens. Also 45 mins is not a given, its a typical time we aim for. It can be shorter or longer depending on the nature of the questions in the ROE. Each one is unique. There have been ROEs as long as 2 hours and on the minimum side 30 mins.",

Could you please clarify if the submission dates will be changed accordingly? I am assuming it will have to be changed for Assignment 7 as well. Please let me know rough submission dates if possible so that I can plan accordingly (my schedule in the upcoming days is very hectic). @Yogesh GA6 will be released sometime this week. All GAs have a minimum 9 days for submissions. We do not have an ETA for Project 2 yet. Kind regards @carlton If possible, could you inform what weeks the project 2 would be based on (like Project 1 was based on week 3 content). Thanks in advance. Project 1 was based on Module 1 through 3. Project 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the exclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase. We generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started. The GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more. We try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs. Hence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system. Hope that give you some insight into how TDS works. Thanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP. Kind regards",

      "content": "Hello Sir, I understand from the email we received that there are three mock ROEs scheduled. I wanted to check if it is mandatory to attempt the mock at 7 PM or if there is flexibility in the timing. As a working professional, I may not be able to attempt the mock at 7 PM. Could you please confirm if there is any flexibility in the timings? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide details on when and how the mock links will be shared. Thanks and Regards Shalini Tag the TAs and instructor. Otherwise, you may not get the answer in time… It is not mandatory to attempt mocks at 7pm. But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later. ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma. Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities. The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time. The problem is the lack of time. So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand. Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next. Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE. The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before. But we will help you be as ready as possible for it. Kind regards hi @carlton how are we supposed to give the mock ROE? where can I find the link? should i join gmeet while solving mock ROE or is it non-proctored? kindly clarify these doubts. thanks in advance! You will get an email at 7pm with the ROE dataset and the question form. I will also add the same in the student seek portal. Mock ROEs are not proctored (its a mock!) and the actual ROE is not proctored either! The gmeet is after the mock ROE where it will be solved live by the TDS team. Kind regards 3 questions:- will the questions and dataset be available after time limit? will the solutions be available for later reference with the questions? will the live solving video lecture be recorded? 23f1002382: will the questions and dataset be available after time limit? They will be available after the live session has finished. 23f1002382: will the solutions be available for later reference with the questions? We will provide an answer script for Mock ROE1 23f1002382: will the live solving video lecture be recorded? Yes our live sessions will be recorded. thanks for the prompt response! Cheers . Also to my understanding at sharp 7:00 we get email with form link and questions dataset? Hi @carlton , I will not be able to solve the mock in the given time due to other commitments. The grading document says 2 marks bonus for mocks. Will this be a part of that? If yes, is there any other way? As you have mentioned, I will keep a timer and try to solve it in 45 minutes. carlton: No, we do not provide solutions as a notebook. The ROE will be solved during the live session. yes in live session ROE was solved but while taking reference for Q1 from live session from TAs to see how this question might be solved as i was getting wrong answer, but TA also didnt solved that question in correct manner he got wrong, I think we should have at least 1 standard ref for all the questions of this mock roe to understand our mistakes in solving this questions pls understand thanks, also when i went throught live session recording i can see only 1 screen of 1 ta Hi @shubhamatkal , For question1 provided answer is wrong. Regarding yesterday’s ROE we will send out ipynb with snippets of code that’s requried to solve questions. For Today’s ROE you will be able to check answers immediately For Thrusday’s ROE as well there will be some mechanism for checking answers. Kind regards.",

We will be sharing some important information during that session which will help you for your ROE. It is available in your google calendar. The meet link for that session is: ROE Preparation - TDS Friday, February 28 · 8:00 – 10:00pm Time zone: Asia/Kolkata Video call link: https://meet.google.com/nnq-sxqh-ryw The session will be recorded and live streamed on YouTube. It will be available on the TDS YouTube Playlist later. Kind regards, TDS Team Update 4 27/02/2025 7:18pm Dear Learner, Please find the link to Mock ROE 3 below. Note the datasets links are present inside the given document (there are more than 1): drive.google.com MOCK ROE 3.pdf Google Drive file. The estimated time for this Mock ROE 3 is 45 mins. All the best, TDS Team Update 3 26/02/2025 8:11 pm Dear Learner Please access the Mock ROE 2 at this link: exam.sanand.workers.dev Technical Assessment There is no time limit for this Mock. The expected time to solve this ROE is 45 mins. Set an alarm and try it. After the session at 9pm there will be a session where we will show you the solutions step by step (not like the previous session which was a demo of ROE). To check your answers you will need to run the following script in the console. inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input') textboxes = document.querySelectorAll(\"textarea\") buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button\") inputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled')); buttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled')); textboxes.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled')); Do not submit or save your answers. All the best! Kind regards TDS Team Update 2 26/02/2025 11:00 am We will be releasing Mock 2 tonight on an exam portal at 8pm (no time limit). The link for the Mock 2 will be available in this post as well as in the Seek Portal. An email will also be sent with the link to Mock 2. We will be conducting a solving session at 9pm. This will be a regular teaching session (not like the first session on Tuesday 25/02/25 which was a real preview of what ROE looks like). Kind regards, TDS Team Update 1 25/02/2025 7:46pm We have now closed the mock submissions. Both the dataset and the form submissions will reopen after tonights live session. Announcement 25/02/2025 This same information is available in the seek portal as well. The data for Mock ROE 1 is available at this link: Jivraj-18/tds-jan-2025-mock-roe-1 The questions for Mock ROE 1 is available at this link: https://forms.gle/UWhvLQvjrJmnvMSn6 IMPORTANT: We will accept only a single submission of the Mock Question Form. Solve all the questions first, and then fill the form and make a single submission at the end. The form submission will be temporarily closed after 8pm. We have provided this for you to test yourself. The expected time to complete this Mock ROE is 45 mins. We will allow access to the Mock ROE and the question form after the live solving session tonight. All the best! Should we use data mentioned in headline of form or mail data. ? From where can I get today’s live sessions link either is fine. Both have the same data but slightly different presentations From google calendar Google Workspace Shareable Online Calendar and Scheduling - Google Calendar Use Google Calendar to share meetings and schedule appointments, for managing what matters in your business and personal life, with Google Workspace. You should subscribe to tds calendar. Its available in the TDS Portal meet.google.com/odh-ycbm-ahj form link not working Yes we close it at 7:45pm We will reopen after live session tonight. Its a timed mock. atleast close 5 mins early I would have copied the questions live session gmeet link is not available? After seeing the Mock, I have to say, please give more time for ROE exam, anything less than 1 hour seems extremely difficult. where can we find link for recording of live session which happened after this mock roe ? thanks When will it reopen? dear @carlton when will yesterday’s recorded session on mock ROE 1 be uploaded on YouTube? @23f2003413 We will have it uploaded sometime this morning. It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things: The chaos of ROE. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this). The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team. The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well). How limited the time is. The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE. Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us. Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit). I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock. Kind regards Thank you! will check out the session today Hello @carlton sir , for me given constituency was \"SRI GOBINDPUR\" and in the dataset there are multiple names for this constituency i think over the period names were changed of this constituency i have filtered constituencies from punjab using below code in colab df_gobindpur = df[df[\"AC\"].str.contains(\"SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR\", case=False, na=False)] is this correct approach or i have to consider only SRI GOBINDPUR name only? but then this constituency is not availble after 1957 using above filtering i got below data for SRI GOBINDPUR drive.google.com df_gobindpur.csv Google Drive file. then i used margin formula as margin_percentage = ((winner_votes - runner_up_votes) / total_votes) * 100 using this i got answer for 1st question as YEAR 1992 AC 4 SRIHARGOBINDPUR WINNER 1 GURNAM SINGH WINNER_PARTY CPI WINNER_VOTES 5000.0 RUNNER_UP 2 MUSTAK MASIH RUNNER_UP_PARTY INC RUNNER_UP_VOTES 1115.0 MARGIN_PERCENTAGE 50.599114 which is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64 pls guide where i might be wrong, thanks shubhamatkal: df_gobindpur = df[df[\"AC\"].str.contains(\"SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR\", case=False, na=False)] For this kind of name difference you can use Openrefine software shubhamatkal: which is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64 That answer is wrong, we will be releasing a script with correct python snippets. Kind regards. @Jivraj @carlton “SATHUPALLE” and “NILANGA” were two of the four constituencies which were assigned to me. However, even with phonetic match, I couldn’t find any data for these. Closest I could find to SATHUPALLE is “Sattenapalle”, however, two are different locations 150km+ apart as per google maps. Are these really in the dataset? Hi @23f2005138, We didn’t validate locations on Nominathim, so there might be some problems. kind regards The way the instructor extracted the data was not clear in the live session. Please release code or explain properly please. @Jivraj @carlton Hi @23f1002382 Solutions for ROE will be released soon. Kind regrads @carlton @Jivraj @s.anand Is the Mock ROE link out, if it is please merge into that, i could not find it. If it is not yet updated, please do and also merge with relevant post please, Cheers Is the link out? … For Feb 26th? 8 pm? no communication regarding ROE-2? https://22f3001919.github.io/tds_project_1_may_24/ also this link is down? dataset for ROE 1? do we have mock ROE 2 today @carlton ? Kindly confirm the timings! Did you all not solve the ROE already? Q1: Download and unzip q-count-gold-ticket-sales-from-html.zip. It has a set of HTML files, each with tables of 3 columns: Type, Units, and Price. What is the total sales of all the items in the “Gold” ticket type?

Kind regards @23f1002382 Good to see students are collaborating for Solving questions, this is exactly what helps a lot in real ROE. @all Q: You are the operations manager for World Courier. You are trying to find the shortest path between Doha and Muscat. World Courier has a fleet of aircraft that can fly directly between specific cities. The distance between two cities is the Haversine distance. What is the sequence of cities that you should fly to minimize the total distance traveled? Write the answer as a sequence of cities separated by commas.

Just copy paste in excel 45 min up? Not even half WEW how? like extract data with excel with link and table number? No just copy and paste from webpage to google sheets or excel and then save as csv Yeah it works THANK YOU Just to confirm, we are allowed to collaborate our code with our peers? Sir, Can we get these live sessions recorded on YouTube We are expecting you to collaborate. But you got to do it in a methodical organised way. Like NASA trying to get the 3 men in Apollo 13 back home. Work together like a team. One man band is tough or impossible. So is a hodgepodge of directionless people. So a proper team can perhaps crack it. Kind regards But there is seems to be a very thin line between collaborating and people just taking other people’s code and using them to generate their answer instead of also participating in the collaboration. So I was confused about the “collaborating” thing. I understand that sentiment. I struggle with it a lot too when discussing it with Anand. Is there value or learning, in blind copying. Im not so sure. At some point someone has to learn to become an expert. A critical thinker. There is even a Microsoft study now that shows that GPT usage impacts critical thinking. Are we going to end up with a generation of people who can no longer critically think to solve a problem? These are good philosophical questions. I lie somewhere more on the conservative side of that spectrum. But everyone has to grapple with this tradeoff. Where does the right balance lie? I don’t know the answer to that question for others. I know the right answer for me. Kind regards Thanks, today’s mock was manageable unlike yesterday’s one. I got some correct within 45 minutes, but yesterday, I couldn’t even complete scraping. I feel less complex (but still questions that test your critical thinking) and proctored ROE (with access to documentation of the different services used) could help. In this way people can use gpt models to crack the difficult GA questions but through ROE you can actually still test their knowledge on the topics which are covered. But this too has its caveats, there doesn’t seem to be a proper solution to this There was no need to scrape Sagan, you could have copied the whole table and pasted it into an excel sheet and exported it as a csv file. Try it out once! sir only 26feb one is available but session of roe on 25feb is not available can u please upload it and yeah even live session schedule for this is also not showing . wanted to know the format ,if its like a oppe or just a graded assignment with time limit . Will be uploaded sometime by tomorrow. Live schedule is on the calendar, sometimes google calendar can be glitchy. you might have to check your settings and make sure you have subscribed to the right calendar What all weeks are included in ROE?? Modules 1 to 5 is the syllabus for ROE. We will do a final run down of the topics on a special (highly recommended) friday session (will be scheduled shortly). Kind regards Mock ROE-1 & Mock ROE-2 sessions have not yet been uploaded in YouTube yet @carlton . Can you please upload both these videos at the earliest so that we could prepare from those videos. Many of us have no idea about how to solve these questions within the given timeframe, so it is highly appreciable that the team uploads these recorded live sessions in YT at the earliest. Thanks! The recordings of these sessions are already available. Mock 1 Mock 2 They are all available in the calendar image541×678 45.1 KB do we have the Mock-ROE today? @carlton image1284×729 51.3 KB Question 2 of the patent questions is missing, is it intentional? @23f2004837 Yes its available in the first post of this page, as well in email and online seek portal. @trebhuvansb There is only 1 patent question. Intentional, its hard enough to do all questions @carlton How many questions will we be having in our ROE? Because I remember Anand sir mentioning 17 questions in the explanation of the difficulty of the ROE It completely depends on the ROE. There is just no reasonable way of knowing how many questions ROE will have. If there is only 1 question, I would be very worried. Kind regards Hi @carlton sir, I have not got any mail for the ROE exam yet. Can you please check this out and conform me. And also tell us, how will we access the exam. I thought the mocks would be a representation of the actual ROE and the mocks had 6 questions so I assumed 6 questions. Mocks are just to give you a feel of what an ROE is about, and to get you comfortable with the 45 min time limit. So, the number of questions in the real ROE is going to have little correlation with the question count in the mocks. Respected @s.anand , @Jivraj , @carlton Based on the ROE mock assessments, I kindly request you to consider extending the allotted time for the ROE. Some tasks require downloading libraries, whereas you may already have these libraries or other necessary setups in place, which naturally reduces your solving time. As you are aware, additional time will only benefit those who have prepared and possess the required knowledge. Students without preparation will not gain any advantage simply due to an extension. Furthermore, as the course has been modified from the previous term and many aspects are still being refined, we have already requested measures to support our performance and ensure our grades are not put at undue risk. I genuinely prioritize knowledge over marks and have put in significant effort to excel in this course. However, I do not want to risk failing. My goal is simply to meet the passing criteria (at least 40 marks) . Therefore, I sincerely request you to consider granting additional time for the ROE as a reasonable relief. Your understanding and support in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Best Regards, Lakshay Yes sir it will be helpful for us Yes @carlton sir, please look into it and we request you to extend the allotted time. “If there is only 1 question, I would be very worried” Found this to be funny! Yeah especially if the system is slow, it takes too much time to download libraries. Colab provides more RAM but it frequently stops runtime and restarting it again is very time-consuming. Can we team up with you in roe ??? @carlton Can you please share the pdf that you were showing in today’s meeting Hi @23f1001231 link is now available in the first post of this thread. image1595×597 89.4 KB @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini This is a question of GA 3. I tried AI hallucination, but was unsuccessful. Can you please tell what will be the appropriate prompt? Hi @23f1001231 Here is a blog post made by Anand Sir Hacking an obnoxious, unhelpful LLM to say Yes - S Anand Give it a read, it would be helpful. What is the highest average inspection score in the month 2015-05 that any latitude- longitude grid (rounded off to 2 decimal places) has received? not receiving right answer any body tried mock 4 for tds roe exam Hi, I have started attempting the MOCKs, But I don’t know how to scrap the data from the link which is provided for MOCK 1. I couldn’t find this in recorded sessions as well. Anyone please suggest a way to do it. agreed, the time is very less we can solve all questions if time is increased, even a little from shapely.geometry import Polygon, Point import json with open(\"regions.json\", \"r\") as f: data = json.load(f) pickup_locations = [ (6.488, -78.0287), (32.0198, -99.7243), (16.7257, -58.7811), (1.9307, 45.4928), (-34.6289, 133.0359) ] cities = data[\"cities\"] regions = data[\"regions\"] matching_regions = [] for request_point in pickup_locations: point = Point(request_point) region_num = 1 for region in regions: region_coordinates = [(cities[city][0], cities[city][1]) for city in region] region_polygon = Polygon(region_coordinates) if region_polygon.contains(point): matching_regions.append(str(region_num)) break # Stop checking once a match is found region_num += 1 print(\",\".join(matching_regions)) I have been trying this for the past 1 day and i still cant get the answer for mock roe 2, q5 2 of my coordinates r not giving any value can someone please help @carlton The json from the webpage does not match the data in the mock roe webpage. Its a little trick that Anand implemented so that its not so easy to do. It was basically to see if you could spot the difference. These things do happen in the real world where the backend sends something and someone has done some जुगाड़ code on the front end just to get the job done for the client. So when you are trying to scrape the data for some analysis things dont quite seem what they are.",

          "content": "@23f2003413 We will have it uploaded sometime this morning. It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things: The chaos of ROE. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this). The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team. The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well). How limited the time is. The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE. Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us. Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit). I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock. Kind regards",

Some tasks require downloading libraries, whereas you may already have these libraries or other necessary setups in place, which naturally reduces your solving time. As you are aware, additional time will only benefit those who have prepared and possess the required knowledge. Students without preparation will not gain any advantage simply due to an extension. Furthermore, as the course has been modified from the previous term and many aspects are still being refined, we have already requested measures to support our performance and ensure our grades are not put at undue risk. I genuinely prioritize knowledge over marks and have put in significant effort to excel in this course. However, I do not want to risk failing. My goal is simply to meet the passing criteria (at least 40 marks) . Therefore, I sincerely request you to consider granting additional time for the ROE as a reasonable relief. Your understanding and support in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Best Regards, Lakshay",

      "content": "Dear @jkmadathil @Anand @Bharathi First and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TDS team in supporting us throughout this course. The live sessions and guidance have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience. However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations. Key Challenges Faced Lack of Prerequisites This course did not list any prerequisites, leading many students—including those from non-technical backgrounds—to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the course content, assignments, and projects have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage. Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure The difficulty of the projects has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to rely heavily on peer support just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully. Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback Many students joined TDS based on past Discourse posts and feedback, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for working professionals and students without prior experience. Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs) While we have put in significant effort—spending 2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs) to secure good scores—we still find ourselves struggling to meet expectations for the projects and RoE, which are significantly harder than anticipated. We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course. We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed. Thank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives. Yes sir please look into this @Anand @Bharathi Yes ma’am please pay attention to our concern. Yes sir, even it is tough for tech background students, just think about that how non-tech background students are handling the pressure for this course. Please consider this request. @carlton , @Saransh_Saini , @Jivraj , @Anand Yes @s.anand sir @jkmadathil sir @Bharathi Mam, Plss look into this as this is becoming too too hectic ans stressful now Mam. Right, I put 3 to 4 days on a GA. I still am not able to fully grasp the concept. I tried to attempt today’s mock roe, it was a disaster. I hope I can do better on next mock. I completed my project but due to some issue I failed to submit it. That’s was my mistake, and I highly regret it. I lost 20 marks because of it despite working so hard. Hi @s.anand @jkmadathil @Bharathi @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Could you please look into the above issue? Additionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring: Grading Concerns Final Course Score: T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F (The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.) From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students: What’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?. Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores. Furthermore, for Project 1 (deadline: 16th Feb 2025), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1. Course Structuring & Scheduling Issues Many students pursuing this course are dual-degree students or working professionals, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines. The last-minute guidance for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments. The structuring and scheduling of sessions feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time. Request for Improvement To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request: Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2, well in advance of the deadline. More structured and accessible support, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals. Better management of exam difficulty levels, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough. I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response. Please look into it sir. Thank you @A_LAKSHMI for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response. Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the grading pattern will not be changed. And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP. TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words: This course is quite hard Here’s students’ feedback: It used to be an easy course until 2024. # # # Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # # Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # # LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # # The ROE is hard. # Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you’re ready for this course. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now. TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help Again to quote Anand: We encourage learning by sharing You CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam). Why should you copy? Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well. To learn well, understand what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize. To learn better, teach what you’ve learnt. Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself). Once again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable and internally make us more humble. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them. @22f2001640 Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity. Regarding your point of the short term benefits of grades vs the long term benefits of learning, I think I’m speaking for a lot of my peers that we’re not concerned about grades at this point, we just at least want to pass this course. I’m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this hard work I should be able to pass the course. While grades don’t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I’m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me. I understand that the grading can’t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass. Nicely highlighted the concern of all students. TDS as a course has been really tedious this term. It’s a headache for those with non-technical background. IITM Management please look into this matter on urgent basis. Dam… Even when I have finished the course (with a B ) I’m still getting dragged into this … But still this is a huge Problem … jkmadathil: LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # # Great! a nice post sir, I accept it is hard and I am harder than this too. Truly agree with your point. It is hard. If the marking scheme is unpredictable, why not remove the whole grading system from this course. This is punishment even when you do learn. Hopefully, I would like a better grading system in future, even the course is designed very well! Seeing the difficulty of TDS I feel like appying to Anand Sir’s company lol. I am barely surviving but enjoying every moment of it. But seriously though remembering everything is super difficult. You will survive. Just watch tonight’s session. and prepare and practise.",

Yeah they said you can take help anyway possible even to ask a cat also or a pet, im not sure Alright, works. I am down to collaborate. Asking help is different from sharing answers in a public forum. I don’t think they will permit this. Sharing answers is asking for help If the ROE is like how it was for MOCK ROE1 then this probably wont work right? Only for today’s ROE(mock 2) we can split the tasks efficiently and get it done. Thoughts? trebhuvansb: Asking help is different from sharing answers in a public forum. I don’t think they will permit this. this is valid. should we just ask them? Could u message a TA? Yeah thats the idea… What's the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam? Tools in Data Science @ankit.jain – I’m the culprit behind this RoE structure. Thanks for the opportunity to share my thought process. What does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning. Implicit learning is “How much can they answer if woken up from sleep?” Explicit learning is “How much can they answer given time and Internet?” Some may know 10% implicitly. Some know 50%. They’ll answer those in a few seconds. Some, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That’s explicit learning. But it takes time… Their whole concept of implicit learning disappears when people start sharing answers in a public forum. On another topic et? read the post, its about explicit learning xD EDIT its implicit my bad ! off topic, how do you dm people on discourse? So, are we using this thread, or should we make a Google space or something? I created a discord Discord Join the ACING ROE 1 Discord Server!

The Remote Online Exam has been scheduled for Sunday, 2nd March 2025 (02/03/2025 ) at 1:00pm The exam link will become available at the below mentioned site, 1 hour before the start time: https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/exam.html [EDIT] There will be a Gmeet manned by the course team from Sunday, March 2, 2025 7:20 AM→Sunday, March 2, 2025 8:20 AM to solve your technical issues (timeouts, question not visible etc). Please do not ask concept related questions in this meet. Use this only for clarifying technical issues. If your issue is resolved, PLEASE EXIT THE MEET. Lurkers will be penalized There is a bonus provided for student feedback on the ROE exam preparation and attempt. This will be available till Sunday, March 2, 2025 11:30 AM All the best, TDS Team Would we be able to start work on the questions 1 hour before the exam start time? @bhashwar_sengupta No that will not be possible. It will go live only at 1 pm. Got it. Thank you. Also, are there any standard set of instructions that we need to follow during the ROE, like in OPPEs? Is it 45 minutes long? No, it is 45 minutes ‘short’ @carlton will exam take place on the IITM Exam Portal (like other JAVA, Python OPPE) or will it take place on the TDS course portal like we had for Weekly GA? Hello @carlton sir, I could only find one live session of ROE in youtube. Can you please point out where are the other recordings? All week 7 sessions are ROE mock solving questions. Only the 4th session was a special session and was labelled as such, but it also has a mock solving component. These are all available on the Youtube channel Sir we have to join the google meet for ROE or it’s an open book exam? Is there a google meet that we have to join for proctoring? @carlton I hope the Remote Online Exam (ROE) is ready to be uploaded to the portal. Is there any update regarding the additional time request? Can we expect any consideration on this? I submitted my request at the following link: Request for additional time for roe @carlton Is the exam link enabled yet?

Its fine the link is correct. Just that the exam is not available at the moment, we have changed the error message. Exam will start at 1pm. Its also hackable to start before. You will have a check button We have updated the error message. yes … us ai, phone a friend, also ping here… ping here? does that mean we are allowed to discuss here? No this thread is only for technical doubts faced by students. But, you can create another thread to discuss it. Thats much encouraged. @24f2007378 thank you, got one extra answer because of this. Thank you Teachers for a great preparation using mock it helped us a lot and really very difficult but interesting exam. Thanks all for ROE exam. Got 9/10 , mostly guessing many might have got full as prev. mocks conducted in last week was used. But, I want to thank for mock sessions , appreciate all you TA’s efforts in last week. Take care Regards, Harsha I tried many times for correlation question. using numoy, excel, writing explicit function. for all the three, i got -0.7144 as the answer. but the portal showed incorrret.

Performed much better in ROE than I expected!! ROE was challenging, but definitely Mocks helped a lot. I think mocks were the best preparation for ROE. Did good because of it. Your answer is absolutely correct @23f2000573 But the problem is you had to submit the answer rounded off to 3 decimal places. A decimal more or less would result in a wrong answer. Hello Sir\"s, @carlton @Saransh_Saini I was able to successfully attempt only 5 questions within the time limit. But due to internet issues, I could not submit exactly at 1:45pm. My last submission was at 1:47pm. But if there was a auto save then you could already check my answers were in the portal. I request you to please consider submission delays of 2-3 mins as this was due a technical glitches. And we too are switching tabs and running in vscode Kind Regards, Muthu Hi @Muthupalaniappan We have got multiple issues like from other students, we are looking into it and figuring out what all we can do. Even I had this issue but it was given in question to round off so once rounded off, i would taken as correct Hello @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini as I already showed you in the meet that while submitting it was already showing 10, and for surety and safety i clicked on SAVE Button, on resaving now it’s showing 0 and dint get submitted properly… As you can see from your records, I have already finished and submitted everything correctly. This carries a lot of weight and will significantly impact my grade, therefore I kindly ask that you take this into account and give me full marks. So i beg you sir for considering my request sir, also attaching the screenshot as you instructed in the meet for your reference sir.

My score initially was 6/10. I was tackling another question and by that time the timer went off. I can even send my answers if required. I should have submitted more frequently, but I was busy solving the other questions for extra marks. Could you please consider my request? Thank you. Major betrayal - laptop, shut down like 5 times during the test losing 10 solid minutes, i think we should have atleast 1 hour from next term onwards image633×512 23.8 KB Sir, I’m facing the same issue. While the recent scores say I have a score of 10, my final score shows 0. Kindly look into this, and please consider the highest marks from recent saves. Thank you. The same happened to me before the exam. Fortunately, I saw it before, and charged my laptop. Charging wasnt an issue for me, my entire vsc just froze and the screen went blank during the last 5 mins. That was exactly when i got the code for q6 and was trying to get the output and it froze, reopened at 1:45 and the time was up Hi @23f2000778 No need to worry about that, I have checked in backend your score is 10 of 10. kind regards Hi @21f3002158 I looked for your result in backend, seems like you didn’t click to submit button throughout the exam. Since roe exam portal was similar to GA’s where you need to save answers using save button, after saving only your answers get evaluated and you get answers. There is no way other than pressing save button, we can’t do any help with this.

Kind regards Hi @22f1000535 We will be giving 2 minutes allowance, answers before 1:47:00 will be evaluated, so you submitted at 1:46 so you will get 8 out of 10. Hi @Muthupalaniappan We have decided to give 2 minutes of allowance for network problems to everyone, so whoever submitted before 1:47:00 will be evaluated, your submission was at 2025-03-02 13:47:43 with 2 marks Kind regard @carlton @Jivraj sir, I got disconnected at around 1:35 due to a network glitch and had to restart my uv server as well collab which wasted around 5 min and my score was around 7 and further I ran multiple scripts which I had already saved as code snippets as part of GA for question 4 on vs code and Collab and finally got the answer but I exceeded the time limit since the submission I made was at 1:47:28 which was 9…so I request to please consider that Overall the ROE was a great experience and I wholly enjoyed the process Thank you for giving us this amazing opportunity 10000320061280×626 125 KB 9 marks? How were you able to crack the ROE? Hi @24f2003130 Your last submission before 1:47:00 was at 2025-03-02 13:42:34 with 8 marks, we will consider that. Kind regards The questions were really similar to the GAs and mocks…I practiced them beforehand and had code snippets ready to use…so I guess that was helpful Ok sir Also I have realised the value of 28 seconds since my last submission (9/10) was at 1:47:28 I respect the rules of the exam and will be more careful in the future exams to avoid such technical glitches. Thank you Thank you so much @Jivraj for taking time out and checking the records and considering my submission. It means a lot! Thanks & Regards, Digvijaysinh Chudasama When I clicked the save button, it took an unusually long time to respond and eventually showed an error. There was no network issue, as other applications were working fine. However, the moment I clicked “Save,” all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive. I’m not sure what caused this problem, but I will share a screenshot to help diagnose the issue.

However, the moment I clicked “Save,” all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive. There was a technical support meeting going between 1 Pm to 1:50 pm on ROE day, you were expected to join that meeting. You didn’t join technical support meet before deadline. image1130×240 10.2 KB Even on discourse we were continuously looking for new posts during ROE, you created discourse post at 2:3 PM which was after deadline so we can’t help with it. I have attempted all the questions in the ROE and solved few of the questions but i forgot to save the submission. At that time, I did not realize that I have not even saved once during the time. After realizing that i have not saved it in the evening, I have used the console to disable the save and saved my answers. Is it possible to validate it? I don’t have any submissions before 1:45pm. I realize that it is my mistake for not being careful about it but i request sir to be lenient about it as the project 1 was also difficult and i have my exams tomorrow. @s.anand @carlton @iamprasna @Saransh_Saini Hi @Jayeshbansal Until not clicked on save button answers get’s checked at frontend side only. There is no way we can validate it after deadline. I trust you would have solved few questions and also would have checked before deadline but clicking on save button was must to get submission evaluated. Kind regards i have not saved even once during the deadline but i have submitted/saved by hacking it in the evening when i realised that i have not saved it, i am asking you to consider that as i really don’t have any saves before deadline which will result me 0 marks, my request is to accept post deadline save by being lenient about it else i will get 0 marks. I will be satisfied even if you consider my 2nd save rather than latest save. (1st save was a sample test to check if possible, so it was 0 marks but the 2nd save is under 1-2 min which may prove that i have done all that questions before) Hi @Jayeshbansal After deadline we gave allowance for 2 minutes considering network issues students might have faced, so till 1:47:00 all submissions will be considered valid, after that we won’t take any submissions. Following are your submissions all of them were after deadline Quiz Email Time Total Max tds-2025-01-roe roe-24f1001895@ds.study.iitm.ac.in 2025-03-02 19:29:49 9 10 tds-2025-01-roe roe-24f1001895@ds.study.iitm.ac.in 2025-03-02 19:26:52 8 10 tds-2025-01-roe roe-24f1001895@ds.study.iitm.ac.in 2025-03-02 19:26:48 8 10 tds-2025-01-roe roe-24f1001895@ds.study.iitm.ac.in 2025-03-02 19:25:36 0 0 Kind regards Hello sir, @Jivraj Do you mean you will not consider them for evaluation then? Yes, it won’t be considered. yes, as you can see my first save is at 7:25 which was a trial check if post submission is working or not but you can see that the 2nd and 3rd are saved in approx 1 minute but i got 8 corrects which proves that i have done it before only. the latest save got 9 marks as i forgot to run the fastapi server for 1st mark which resulted me 3 more minutes. So, I request sir to consider any one of the saves except the first save Sorry @Jayeshbansal All your submissions were around 7 hours after 1:47:00 Pm, that’s why we won’t consider them for evaluation. Kind regards Hi @23f3002537 The problem is that, here you are sending headers unnecessary and overwriting the original headers. Moreover you were returning the text of the response instead of the json. Here is the revised version. from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware import httpx import uvicorn app = FastAPI() # Add CORS middleware to handle preflight OPTIONS requests app.add_middleware( CORSMiddleware, allow_origins=[\"*\"], allow_credentials=True, allow_methods=[\"*\"], allow_headers=[\"*\"], ) @app.get(\"/api\") async def proxy(url: str, request: Request): headers = {key: value for key, value in request.headers.items() if key.lower() != \"host\"} try: async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client: response = await client.get(url) return response.json() except httpx.RequestError as e: raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f\"Request failed: {str(e)}\") if __name__ == \"__main__\": uvicorn.run(app, host=\"127.0.0.1\", port=8000) Hello @Jivraj sir, Will it be possible to consider only the minutes. I also cannot control the technical delays. I raised the point as fast as possible and I also joined the technical GMEET and exited when a different person raised the same question. I would dearly propose to consider still 1:47. But if it’s 1:48 you can ofcourse not consider it. But the “seconds” is something unrealistic. Please re consider this request sir. @Jivraj Could you please verify if my score will be accepted by you? I saved only once: at 1:47 pm. My roll number is 21f2001573. @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini When will the results of ROE will out. Probably, by this week I checked your submission, its at 1:47:30 PM. We are going to give a grace period of 2 minutes past 1:45 PM. Given that you submitted 30 seconds past 1:47, we won’t be able to consider it. Regards Please reconsider this decision. In the heat of the moment, I failed to save. In my mind, I was sure that I had saved it. There is one other student with the same problem ( saved a few seconds after 1:47). Since I did only one save, I would get zero marks if the score is not considered. I didn’t submit any new answer after 1:45 pm. Please reconsider if possible. @Jivraj @carlton Thank you, much appreciated. Hi @Yogesh1 @24f2003130 @Muthupalaniappan Quick update: I discussed with internal team we are now giving an allowance till 1:48:00. Kind regards Hi @Jivraj sir, I sincerely appreciate the extension and the understanding from the course team. This really means a lot, and I am truly grateful for the support. Thank you for your time and effort in making this possible. Kind regards, Shambhavi Verma Thanks a lot for this. 9 posts were merged into an existing topic: Programming Quiz 1 - showing absent @24f2003130 @23f1002630 @23f2004169 @22f3001272 They only started pushing the scores a few minutes ago, so just wait for the update to finish. Check again and confirm after a few hours. Thanks Am facing the same issue sir, will wait a few hours and update… I ensured I submitted atleast 5 times till 1:45 I submitted 5 times minimum before 1:45 with a score of 7 @Jivraj @carlton out of curiosity i also submitted thrice after exam at like 2 or so just to know how to solve the other qs withscore of 9. I will get the 7 considered right? I submitted them at like 1:43 or so. Please confirm. It still shows absent @Jivraj @carlton Do we get bonus marks for submitting the student feedback Google Form? Sir , it is still showing absent for me for Roe result, I had submitted before the deadline as well my score was 2/10 but the result is showing absent. Can u please look into this and revert Any updates sir ? @carlton @Jivraj It was told, it will be updated in a few hours and now it’s been a day. Am scared! Dont worry, we have the right scores on our server. There has been some problem in sending the export to the operations team. Your scores are safe. We are working on figuring out the problem. Even the bonus marks are recorded. Just give us a couple of days to sort it out. Many students have been affected so we cant give individual responses right now. Its a system fix that needs to be implemented. Respected Sir, I noticed that my status is still marked as absent. I understand I may be a bit impatient, but I wanted to clarify my submission. I had submitted the ROE on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed until 1:47 PM. Even after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term’s project was tougher than the last. Even if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it’s my mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form. Since this is a standalone degree for me, I’m actually worried about it. When I learned how to unlock the ROE, I completed it in a very short time. Please consider the top marks even when did after the normal deadline as marks still got submitted rollnumber 23f2001390 Screenshot 2025-03-09 at 2.42.50 pm1914×194 12.2 KB The latest submission before the deadline would be 3 marks. That is what would be considered. Ok sir will the bonus 1 mark also be included for filling the gform, also I had scored 10 later is that also there or only 4 max is present? yes 1 bonus will be added if you filled the form according to the instructions.

I had submitted the ROE on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed until 1:47 PM. Even after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term’s project was tougher than the last. Even if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it’s my mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form. Since this is a standalone degree for me, I’m actually worried about it. When I learned how to unlock the ROE, I completed it in a very short time.

Deadline: Monday, March 31, 2025 6:29 PM If someone Scrapes the GA Questions with Answers , Can you Please Send them , All of us have might have different GAs (a lil bit maybe), so more data more helpful. PLEASE HELP… Project 2 - TDS Solver - Shared Data Pool Tools in Data Science Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread Creating this Thread to share answers and questions from your respective assignments Why? If we can Train the LLM with these Questions already, we can easily do well? Too many Questions for LLM True we can use embeddings, map that stored in-system dictionary and use relevant questions from in-system data to send as context with answer What We need from YOU 🫵🏽 Get to scraping your respective Gra… @all is it possible to have written solutions to all 5 assignments , instead of just live sessions. I have certain pending questions from the first 5 assignements. Please quickly arrange a live TDS session to explain this project. There are a lot of doubts and questions in our minds. Please also give access to the answers for GAs. So that we can evaluate our api with the correct answers. @carlton sir, is there any bonus marks for code uniqueness and extra tasks like project 1 If we use ngrok to create a tunnel to our API or Llamafile server, for how long should our terminal remain running? Should it be active only at the time of submission, or must it be continuously available until evaluation is completed? Is it like only the questions from the portal will be sent to the api? If yes, is this project just about finding which question is asked and accordingly match the answer send the answer as response? image935×173 6.54 KB Hello Sir, I understand that we can deploy on vercel. Can it be deployed on Heroku as well? I believe both serve the same purpose. Wanted to know your thoughts on the same sir. Thanks and Regards Shalini If you use ngrok, ensure that it is running continuously until you get your results Any question from first 5 Ga’s can be there and you would need to analyze which question it is, you can use function calling or prompting as well. Function calling is better approach here. Hi @24f2006531 You can deploy it anywhere, just test how it works on Heroku, if it works(send request to api endpoint to your application and it should respond with answer) Kind regards will the asked question be same which was asked in my GAs (i mean there were variations in problem statements for diff-diff students.) @Jivraj sir Was the variation because of the datasets? Or even the problem statement? Mostly problem statement like different cities etc Then it comes down to what the project demands, as in what kind of questions the llm will be tested on (like you said). Hope the team can give us a test set like in the first project. my question is some graded assignments have image files as a answer, so should our api return files as the answer or like can you clarify what type of answers we need to work on? I guess yes, our APIs should return photos if required @all Keep posting your doubts here we will have answers to all of your doubts In Thursday’s session. Kind regards Sir will it answer deployment question? like what will be output link or anything else? @Jivraj Could we have a tutorial-type session, similar to the one provided for Project 1, just before the deadline? There are a total of 57 questions in all 5 GAs(18+10+9+10+10). Due to so many different formats of accepting questions and solving them, my main question is: Is the main essence of this project related to deciphering cryptic js code in order to scrape it? Some other doubts are Some questions ask for you to access some hidden divs in the html page and use that for solving (like week 1 q11) Some questions ask you for AIPROXY TOKENs (like week 3 q9) Some questions required manual correction to get correct answers (like week 4 q2) Some questions require file output (like week 2 q2) How do we account for this? @Jivraj @s.anand @carlton I have few questions just going through the Project 2 problem statement. Are we supposed to use OpenAI api’s or locally/private hosted one? Many of the questions need files or images or audio files as input, same api is expected to handle those also? Can we work in a team and submit the project together? If we are to use locally hosted llm system, our systems are not strong enough to run most of the good ones locally Is it possible to get a TA to collaborate in our project as an observer? awaiting a response. Thank you… LLM is god, if you dont know how to use llm in your work, you are failed students. unnecessary project statement. Is it okay if my api only answers the questions which were asked in my GAs ? @carlton sir @Saransh_Saini please confirm this query sir @Jivraj because most of them are very hard to make automated. @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Dear Sir, I have few questions. It is written in the Tools in Data Science that we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I don’t think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below. In GA 1 ques 13 and GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI gh which we have to install in the vercel instance using apt package manager. But, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages. In GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that? Also after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first install ngrok package. In GA 2 ques 8, uploading an image to Dockerhub requires docker package installed. In GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance? Many ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled. Can Vercel allow/do that? And many more Most tasks mentioned above like installing packages etc. requires sudo privilages or may face restrictions set by Vercel. Vercel does not provide sudo access or any form of root access to its hosting environment which is required to perform the above tasks. Many of these task can be done in our local systems (exposing to internet using cloudflare tunnels/ngrok), but we cannot run our systems 24*7 during evaluation. I can see only one option left that is renting a VPS from server providers like digitalocean, gcp, aws etc, which will provide us sudo access and 100% uptime. Also, some ques requires external toolings like In GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365. In GA1 ques 6, we have to use Devtools to show/find the hidden element in the question. Now, the question parameter in the POST request will be plain text, so how the element can hide there? GA 2 ques 4 and GA 2 ques 5 uses Google Colab specific python libraries like google.colab which can’t be installed locally. How to solve these above questions that require explicit usage of external tools. Also, handling POST request for some questions are not clear like In GA 2 ques 2, we have to compress the image and upload the image as answer. So, now how to response such answer in json object. Should we encode the resultant compressed image as base64 string or Image URL or Data URI. Some ques have images in them. For those images in GAs, I right clicked and used “Save as” to save the images and then done the required computations. So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment? Another concern is regarding the OpenAI API TOKEN, unlike Project 1, Project 2 does not have an API_TOKEN parameter in the POST request. Hence, the API TOKEN provided from https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev will be also used during evaluation. Now, what will happen if our API TOKEN credits gets end during evaluation. The LLM will throw errors then. Please advise what we should do. please clarify Sir. Can you provide with an evaluation file like we had for Project 1. Can we have groups for this please? @Jivraj @carlton @s.anand If you are talking about the parameters of those questions, then it would be better if you make your API capable of working with different parameters. Well if your API is capable of solving those questions in your GAs with the expected answer, then that’s sufficient validation. If you are indicating towards working collaboratively then, Yes, we encourage you to collaborate with others and collectively work towards solving this project. Even if you are going for the relatively easiest approach of Function Calling, it would require you to code about 50 functions to solve all your tasks. Which is why it is sensible to work collectively. Hello Sir, I have a few questions. Would like your thoughts and suggestions over the same. Currently answers that we have entered for GA’s 1 to 4 are not available and only for GA5 its available. It would be helpful for the project (when running the Curl command for each of the question) if the assignments can display the answers we’ve entered as well for verification purposes. The first question of GA1 q1 needs for us to run vs code but when executing it through vercel its not possible because vercel is a serverless environment. In this case, is it okay to manually enter the answer in the code, so when the question is triggered it takes the manual output from the code. Can you provide some clarity as to how the question is supposed to be and structured ? Or should the code be able to handle multiple variants of the question? To address this concern, i tried to implement sentence_transformers using a lightweight model but the vercel application build failed saying that the data is too long and that Vercel serverless function deployment size exceeds the limit of 250 MB. Should i consider deploying elsewhere or change the approach? How do we handle questions pertaining to Devtools - creating input box etc. Thanks and Regards Shalini What does it mean to solve the question? Everyone is asking that? Do you yourself know what to do and to go about it? Or just pull out something from your hAtSS at the last moment? “and responds with the answer to enter in the assignment.” From my understanding only those questions that are solved with a program and give an answer are to be considered… For example it states in the project that \" The response must be a JSON object with a single text (string) field: answer that can be directly entered in the assignment. For example:\" If you all still have not responded, then I’m honestly not sure if this is what y’all meant. Last project was not clear to some extent, This time its even more vague. I understand that y’all want to give different projects to help High Order Thinking skills, but if not executed properly, no one actually learns anything and we(I) just end by debugging the project statement code and question with no relevance to the project. If we wanted to do that, I could just go random GitHub repos and solve and create pull requests for a specific bug. Also we end up losing interest thinking most if the course instructors don’t what they are doing. I understand Anand Sir is extremely busy(like really busy lol), but what are the course instructors doing? @Saransh_Saini @carlton Sir is it possible to extend the deadline of this project 2 to Arpil. Because of Quiz2 and Vivas of project should be completed in march only as I am degree potential student. Extending the deadline wont be disadvantage also, project2 will be like ET preparation Please consider this request sir Thanks I just want to know if you prefer using an existing language model application where we utilize an LLM (Large Language Model), train it, and format the output. For instance, I used the Gemini API key, integrated it with Python, and then formatted the results with the help of Copilot to achieve the desired outputs. Alternatively, do you want us to create a new LLM model and train it with questions from graded assignments? I’m curious about your preference. Additionally, would you like the LLM to provide specific answers regarding computer specifications, or should it give general specifications? For example, in Graded Assignment 1, there is a question about the editor: Visual Studio Code. Your editor is the most important tool in your arsenal; that’s where you’ll spend most of your time, so make sure you’re comfortable with it. Visual Studio Code is, by far, the most popular code editor today. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you’ll likely work with others who use VS Code, so having some exposure is beneficial. To get started, you can watch these introductory videos (totaling 35 minutes) from the Visual Studio Docs: Getting Started: Set up and learn the basics of Visual Studio Code (7 min) Code Editing: Learn how to edit and run code in VS Code (3 min) Productivity Tips: Become a VS Code power user with these productivity tips (4 min) Personalize: Personalize VS Code to make it yours with themes (2 min) Extensions: Add features, themes, and more to VS Code with extensions (4 min) Debugging: Get started with debugging in VS Code (6 min) Version Control: Learn how to use Git version control in VS Code (3 min) Customize: Learn how to customize your settings and keyboard shortcuts in VS Code (6 min) AI Editors: Copilot, Cursor Note: AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help you write code faster. These tools are built on top of VS Code and have become standard in every developer’s toolkit. Please make sure to use them. To install and run Visual Studio Code, open your Terminal (or Command Prompt) and type code -s, then press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below. What is the output of code -s? The output of code -s cannot be universally answered because it depends on the user’s system and the specific version of VS Code installed. The question requests the output of a command that is unique to each user. As for the part about getting answers from the LLM model, I believe that may require using an AI agent. I am currently searching for a solution for this, and I would like to know your thoughts on it. image1214×831 34.8 KB can we make this type of solution for above project yantravid-git-main-vicky-kumars-projects-5400c012.vercel.app IIT Madras Assignment Helper and this is also working with simple question image1260×149 8.95 KB Sir, for GA-5 question number 3 the file is too large to send via request to vercel possible solution is uploading on google drive or smth like that but how will u guys send such long files plus the project only mention sending files not url …Kindly clarify regarding this. image1010×145 13.6 KB Here, the questions entered after the endpoint will be exactly same as the GAs or be similar as the GAs ?? @Saransh_Saini please look into my matter and please clear my doubt @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini I received this mail from TDS Google Group Announcement this morning at 10:30 am. The Project 2 submission date mentioned in the mail i.e. 15 March 2025 contradicts with submission date mentioned in Tools in Data Science and Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread i.e. 31 March 2025. Please clarify. image788×973 265 KB image1069×531 41.8 KB image1115×601 66.5 KB The deadline is 31st March for Project 2. Please ignore the announcement email. We apologise for the confusion. Kind regards Is there any proxy_Ai token as provided earlier for the project 1.. Hi Ayush, Just go the AI Proxy token issue page and re-issue it or use the same one. The limits get reset. Kind regards My Approach , is to scrape and parse all the current question create embeddings , of the questions. create a test endpoint , just to check if i am able to correctly identify the questions segregate numerical , string and json responses and see if these can be answered part of phase 1 Phase 2 , experiment with url based answers. need to see if an MCP server can come in handy to deploy a server and return an url Since the token is limited, I have thought to use the run llms locally, to check for the accuracy of solving the question. I want to know which LLM will be more closer to the one used for evaluating our project. Does the model used for evaluation is capable for handling raw files, or we need to pass it in the text format..(As as I am to recall, the models are capable enough to handle the files..) Thanks! Does anyone willing to work with me..? contact: whatsapp(8697454203) Should we answer the questions and return the response to enter in the answer box(as stated in the question) or should we just provide instructions on how to go about solving the question? Some of the questions include pictures and we cannot use LLM for pictures. Did you just Post your number on a public forum? They(instructors) only don’t what to do it looks like, Anand Sir will tell them and they will tell you (with 25-50 percent lossy communication), just wait and keeping tagging Anand Sir. He will explain clearly, Ask everyone to push for a live session with Anand Sir , that 40 mins he explains will be worth its weight in gold, Hope he does that. Flattery gets me everywhere (not really, I really think Anand Sir is OP. Check out his YT )! @s.anand A good video, with working code for OpenAI agents api .. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Z7u6DTDZ8o should we make the functions on the basis of the GAs or should we make it general so it will be able to perform the task but the data provided will be different. @s.anand @carlton The key learning objective for Project 2 is for you to be absolutely comfortable interacting with APIs and understanding how they work to perform tasks. So there is very little need for the use of LLMs or agents. Identify the the question being asked (how you do this is upto you, you can be as simplistic as using regex to look for some key words, or you can be clever and create embeddings out of the original question and calculate the similarity from the request) Create a function that solves the question with the required parameters and inputs. Remember this does not have to be fancy. Just compute the answer. You do not need to do the task as the GA required. You ONLY want the answer. No tools required. Just a computed answer. Give the answer back as specified. Kind regards carlton: You do not need to do the task as the GA required. Does this mean this type of question won’t be paramaterized? Like instead of code -s there won’t be any other command, otherwise it would require installation of VS Code inside a container to find the answer or this type of questions won’t be part of evaluation at all? The same confusion is for these type of questions as well: Screenshot 2025-03-18 at 5.43.34 PM1329×750 44.4 KB A bit more clarity would be helpful. Thanks in advance. @carlton @s.anand 21f2000709: Like instead of code -s there won’t be any other command, otherwise it would require installation of VS Code inside a container to find the answer or this type of questions won’t be part of evaluation at all? there will not be any other command. This question can be solved with a hardcoded answer Excel and Google sheet questions can be solved by just using python . No excel or google sheets required. The question WILL be parameterised however. So the numbers might be different. You should just understand what the question is asking and solve it programatically to get the answer. Guys, I have designed a new version of this project. Please ask questions related to the graded assignment and let me know if you observe any errors. AI Question Answering Means no github, image related, vs-code, vercel, etc. will be there And the answer will be in string format ?? I am not sure how you came to that conclusion! For example vercel question still requires a vercel endpoint that will respond. What I said is some questions might not need you to use those specific tools. Your answers should still be legitimate answers that one can paste into the text box of a GA and still get it correct. The only question that will not be asked is the LLM say yes question. A github account would still need you to commit a file to it and provide the url that is reachable. etc. @carlton 1 small request.. can we have 2-3 more examples in the project2 description.. so that it gets a bit more clear Prof. Anand Live Session Alert!

But I don’t clearly get one thing. Most of the questions have a question text and a file: csv,zip,json,etc My doubt is, will the request to the end point be : curl -X POST \"https://your-app.vercel.app/api/\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\" \\ -F \"question=question text\" \\ -F \"file=https://stats.espncricinfo.com/stats/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;template=results;type=batting\" my doubt : Is this the only format or can there be other too ? Hi @23f2000573 Yes this is correct format for the question, It will have 2 fields question and file. You can send a file from local machine like this -F \"file=@abcd.zip\" so here abcd.zip must be in current working directory. Kind regards Fine sir, this is clear. I have a few doubts in the file formats. When free, kindly address these to. I will try to cover most common doubts, so that you wouldn’t need to answer similar doubts again. Sorry if some of the doubts are basic / written incorrectly. FILES The data file sent to the api will always be in the requester’s local machine. When the api server receives the request, the file will be in binary format? Or Sometimes the api server receives the file in byte and some times, it will recieve a link like this : https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png This link was take from GA2 Question 2 HTML AND TABLE Some questions have html and tables. In this case will these two be in a file encoded in binary, or will it be a string. Example for string. Consider the table Col 1 Col 2 Row 1, Col1 Row 1 Col 2 Row 2, Col 1 Row 2 Col 2 Will this be something like this \"|Col 1| Col 2|\\n|-|-|\\n|Row 1, Col1 | Row 1 Col 2|\\n|Row 2, Col 1|Row 2 Col 2|\" or something like \"<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Col 1</th>\\n<th>Col 2</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Row 1, Col1</td>\\n<td>Row 1 Col 2</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Row 2, Col 1</td>\\n<td>Row 2 Col 2</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table> \" HIDDEN BLOCK AND ANSWER : 2 TASKS In one question, there were two tasks. Find the answer to the question Enable the disabled text block In this question, what will the answer type be? Should it just be the answer or should it be the html string which will have the disabled block enabled and also the answer string sitting inside the block MORE THAN ONE FILE Some questions have more than one file. For example, the last question of GA5, it has a png file in this link https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/jigsaw.webp and a table. In this case, how will the curl request be? Is it some thing like this curl -X POST \"https://your-app.vercel.app/api/\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\" \\ -F \"question=question text\" \\ -F \"file= Image file\" \\ -F \"file= table file/ string\" CORS HEADERS Will the CORS headers asked in the question be the same or can it be different? Hi, In GA 2, q5, this is the code i got in the question. import numpy as np from PIL import Image from google.colab import files import colorsys # There is a mistake in the line below. Fix it image = Image.open(list(files.upload().keys)[0]) rgb = np.array(image) / 255.0 lightness = np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: colorsys.rgb_to_hls(*x)[1], 2, rgb) light_pixels = np.sum(lightness > 0.554) print(f'Number of pixels with lightness > 0.554: {light_pixels}') Is this the code for others as well? Thanks So I was thinking to create the project 2 together and I was looking for collaboration, and for that we would require the following: → the set of question-answers pairs at first → All the questions of 2 distinct students to see which parameters changes in each questions → Make the solution functional and parameterised based on previous step. Till now I have created the following: → Identification of the question, using embeddings → extraction of parameters using llm for that particular question → Implementation of 3 questions using this approach If we come together, we all can reduce the workload and complete it on time. *Those who resonate with my approach or have any different approach feel free to leave a DM. I might not respond immediately as I might not be online all the time 23f2000573: The data file sent to the api will always be in the requester’s local machine. When the api server receives the request, the file will be in binary format? Or Sometimes the api server receives the file in byte and some times, it will recieve a link like this : https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png file format will be exactly same as corresponding GA. 23f2000573: \"<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Col 1</th>\\n<th>Col 2</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Row 1, Col1</td>\\n<td>Row 1 Col 2</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Row 2, Col 1</td>\\n<td>Row 2 Col 2</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table> This is correct html table format. 23f2000573: Should it just be the answer or should it be the html string which will have the disabled block enabled and also the answer string sitting inside the block It will be just answer. 23f2000573: Some questions have more than one file.

I didn’t get this question, could you point to exact question? Hi @22f3001307 yes it’s same code. Sir, a few things are not yet clear . Jivraj: file format will be exactly same as corresponding GA. Some questions have clickable html buttons. When we click that, the zipfile or json file, or csv gets downloaded Some questions have image attached to the text. For this, we have to use right click → download the image. Here, the image is take from some url. For example. in GA2, q2, the image displayed is taken from https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png. My doubt is, what will be the value of file attribute in curl command Will it be “file=binary of zipfile/csv/json” for the first type and “file=https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png” for the second type Jivraj: This is correct html table format. Will this table be in the “question” attribute of curl or “file” attribute Jivraj: In last question of GA5 there is only one file(image), table is not coming through file, it will be kept same for project2. so, can I assume that the table will be given as a html element in the “question” attribute and the image in the “file” attribute? Sir @Jivraj was yesterday (March 19) 's google meet recorded and available for replay.. @22f3002723 thanks a lot @23f1001231 Hi @23f2000573 23f2000573: Will it be “file=binary of zipfile/csv/json” for the first type and “file=https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png” for the second type Files will be exactly same as GA assignment, if there is url then it will be a url and if it get’s downloaded by clicking then it will come from requester’s machine. 23f2000573: so, can I assume that the table will be given as a html element in the “question” attribute and the image in the “file” attribute? For questions that have table they will either come as html code or as markdown. Keep a if else condition for identifying which case it is, if it’s a html then beautiful soup should be able to find table tag, if it’s markdown table then it can be identified with | characters. Kind regards For GA 1, question 2 Screenshot 2025-03-21 at 4.17.09 PM960×336 28.9 KB The portal accept answers in strict json with double quotes. Now in the project we need to return the answer in string value which again has double quotes, so the best answer I could get is using \\\" inside the answer like this. But still the GA portal marks it as invalid json. What to do in this case? @carlton @Jivraj Hi @21f2000709 image654×681 13.1 KB This works, just send a string which can be loaded as json object. The correct answer has to be with the escape sequence otherwise you cannot send a valid response back. We never feed your response to the GA by copy pasting. Screenshot 2025-03-21 at 5.28.12 pm.png1744×1084 147 KB So the questions expecting JSON will be jsonified separately before passing to the evaluator because in the current implementation in the text field idk why it is failing to load the json with \\\" however I could load the exact thing using json.loads in python. hi @carlton @Jivraj ! could you please provide us with the correct answers for all the 57 GA questions, so that it would be really helpful for us to cross check if our app is returning the correct answer for each question. please consider sharing the correct answers for all the questions as they are not available in the seek portal as well Hi @23f2003413 We won’t be sending codes for any of the questions, regarding validation part you can submit answer to portal and if that works. All first 5 GA’s were conducted on anand sir’s proxy server portal, so just enable check answers button and you can test answers. can u please let me know on how to enable the check answers button? and which proxy server portal are you talking about. please help me out! @Jivraj @carlton sir 10001450151080×2340 234 KB For questions like this (there’s a similar one in GA1 too, will the user send the USER and REPO of their GitHub account as parameters too? Even if they do, my script may not get necessary authentication to create repo and make commit in their repository. In this case, would I have to implement GitHub OAuth flow? If they don’t send those details but just the email and I am expected to just change the email in my own repo and commit, in the worst case making the same change repeatedly may be misconstrued as a DDoS attack by an automated script which may lead to my GitHub account being suspended, which does not seem ideal. Can you please at least hint at a solution? Edit: Same query for the GitHub actions question (GA2 Q7) Another edit: A similar query for GA2 Q8. Repeated dockerimage pushes to Dockerhub with different tags. Use the following script to enable answer boxes and check answers buttons: inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input') textboxes = document.querySelectorAll(\"textarea\") buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button\") inputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled')); buttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled')); textboxes.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled')); This was provided with the Mock ROE2 mail. For GA-1 question 10, we need to get the hash of the json, from the site JSON Hash, I found that underneath it using sha-256 in a function inside the encrypt.js file but still when I implemented the same in python, it is giving a different hash. Can we get the hashing code in python? @carlton @Jivraj Update: I was successful in getting the hash in js. You won’t be required to update someone else’s repo. Any github name, repo name is fine. Just that it should have github pages with that particular email address. 22f3000819: Same query for the GitHub actions question (GA2 Q7) Same for GA2 Quetion7 as well, you github url is required. 22f3000819: If they don’t send those details but just the email and I am expected to just change the email in my own repo and commit, in the worst case making the same change repeatedly may be misconstrued as a DDoS attack by an automated script which may lead to my GitHub account being suspended, which does not seem ideal. Can you please at least hint at a solution? In evaluation we will only send request one worst case twice or thrice if it fails from our end, so no issues with that. 21f2000709: I was successful in getting the hash in js. I was thinking of same solution it would definetly work in js. Okay. Thank you sir. I’ll just do this after the rest for now. Another question .. In GA1 Q6, will the hidden element be sent as an html file or will the tag be included in the question parameter? @carlton and @jivraj, Hello.. I am facing issue with zip file extraction function which is in many GA1 questions. e.g., for GA1 Q15, if I use 7-zip to extract files, it shows the correct total size when using Postman for local server. If I use python built-in function, it calculates a different value (which is incorrect). So, I used 7-zip. But I (with help from copilot agent) am not able to make 7-zip work on the vercel deployment. Can we just hard code the answers to GA1 questions, or is there a way to take answer from local server and use it for response in vercel (sorry, it doesn’t even make sense to me, but a lot of things are hard to understand anyway)? Or how do we resolve this 7-zip issue. Python built-in extraction did not work correctly even after hours of trying.. I have another question. Due to lack of time, if I just submit the Project 2, with question/answers to GA1, (and if these all work as expected on vercel), how much approx score can we get if I am not able to do other GAs at all for Project 2. Edit after posting: I can hard code questions and other answers from GA2 upto GA4 (I missed GA5, so don’t have those answers). Thank you. I too want to know like by 5 questions at random, is it 1 random question per GA or 5 random questions from the entire 5 GAs? In the later case, there would be no certainty unless all of our questions works and there aren’t any unexpected surprises at the evaluation. in the GA 4 question 5 ( Find the bounding box of a city ) Will the OSM_id ending digits be provided. In the question body they are not there but on submission they come like in the attached screenshot. image1614×372 45 KB github.com GitHub - Tusharisme/TDS_Project_2 Contribute to Tusharisme/TDS_Project_2 development by creating an account on GitHub. This is my project github repo link.I just wanted your guys suggestion with this…like am I going correct @carlton @Jivraj @s.anand I faced the same issue. Initially, I used geopy.geocoders to solve the question, and it provided the correct answer during the assignment submission. However, the same approach is now giving an incorrect result. Instead of using geopy, try using this URL directly: https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search . This worked for me. I have a doubt like when I pass answers in string and in the questions about markdown will the \\n characters be properly parsed before checking the correctness of the markdown or will it be directly checked for valid markdown? Because the raw string when pasted in the text box of the GA isn’t getting the markdown. In case of image compression question, should I return the base64 encoding of the compressed image? @Jivraj @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Respected TDS Team, I currently have Three doubts regarding Project 2: As per the 19th March session, it was mentioned that the files would be the same for everyone, and only the parameters in the questions would vary. However, I have noticed that the files can actually be different.

Kindly verify these points before evaluation. Questions Requiring Manual Intervention / Portal-Side Issue GA3 Q8 Issue: The question doesn’t mention all required queries. Although all mentioned queries were added, the portal seems to check for additional queries not stated, resulting in an incorrect answer flag. GA3 Q9 Issue: This question asks to create an LLM prompt, but upon submission, a pop-up requests the AIPROXY_TOKEN. Clarification needed: How are we supposed to handle token-based inputs for evaluation? GA4 Q2 & Q10 Issue: Previously encountered issues have been resolved. Reference: GA4 Q2 and Q10 resolution Output Formatting (Multiple Questions) Issue: When using plain text, the answer is accepted. However, in JSON format, newline characters (\\n) and backslashes are added. Note: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {“answer”: “result”}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal. Vercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment Questions Issue: Some deployment-related questions require a **live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok. Clarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated? Deployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday’s Session) Please include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues: Platform Capability for GA Tasks Which cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably? Note: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage. File Upload Example via Platform API Request: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app. This would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input. General Observations on GA1-5 Output Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine. However, about 20% either have portal-side issues or deployment-related problems. Kindly review these points before final evaluation, and let us know if any additional clarification is required from our side. Thanks a lot @23f2005702, we’ll try to answer these questions in Thursday’s session. Is their any way to solve this issue. @Jivraj @carlton ( @Saransh_Saini ) @Jivraj , is it possible to extend the deadline by 2 days April 1st, since we can use the LLM api a little more and Most people(me atleast) have Their OPPEs and its combined syllabus (and the OPPE 1 did not go well, partly due to my inadequacies) , which has much more to cover, since this project involves more involved coding compared to the last project(ideally project one should have taken not more than a day , still messed it up though xD). Asking for extension for 2 days, if possible. Really need it not even want, like need Summary: Please extend Project 2 deadline by 2 days(April 1st), (actually 1 day extension is April 1st) Hi @23f1002382 , Unfortunately it’s not possible for us to extend the deadline. Project 2 was released almost a month back, and that can be considered ample amount of time to complete the project. I can understand it must be hard to deal with it along with an upcoming OPPE, but this is what it is. Even if you are not able to cover all the 58 questions, try to cover the majority of them, as the evaluation involves sending just 1-3 questions for evals. All the best for your OPPE and your Project 2 @21f2000709 @23f2003751 Yes you are absolutely right. I confirmed this with Carlton and Anand sir, and yes you have to send the JSON responses as strings, which will automatically add those backslashes(\\). I apologies for causing this confusion, and I hope I was able to clarify it. Yes, your response seems correct. It should be a single string containing all the markdown. @Saransh_Saini can you please confirm 5 Qs at random means 5 random Qs from entire 58 Qs or 1 random Q/GA for the evaluation of TDS Project 2. Hi @21f3001993 You can use the zipfile library to extract and access zip files pretty easily. You can even make it so that you don’t even have to download the sent file either zip/csv/etc, in order to access it. All this will be discussed in Thurday’s [27-03-2025] Live Session. Kindly attend the session if you want a deeper understanding of it. It can be any 5 questions. It can be 1-5 random questions from all 58 question. Its not like a random question each from each GA. It’s even possible to get all those 5 questions from one single GA. For GA 2 Question 10, how do we host an LLM on a free vm with very limited resources? Ok, thanks. I won’t be able to attend the session live, but will watch the recording. Thanks for offering to discuss this in live session. just to clarify if the llm is giving the output like this the evaluation script will mark it correct. { \"answer\": \"[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Charlie\\\",\\\"age\\\":16},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Liam\\\",\\\"age\\\":23},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Bob\\\",\\\"age\\\":28},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Grace\\\",\\\"age\\\":36},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Ivy\\\",\\\"age\\\":44},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Jack\\\",\\\"age\\\":53},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"David\\\",\\\"age\\\":56},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Oscar\\\",\\\"age\\\":57},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Karen\\\",\\\"age\\\":65},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Frank\\\",\\\"age\\\":67},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Nora\\\",\\\"age\\\":68},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Emma\\\",\\\"age\\\":70},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Paul\\\",\\\"age\\\":88},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Alice\\\",\\\"age\\\":92},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Henry\\\",\\\"age\\\":94},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Mary\\\",\\\"age\\\":97}]\" } @Jivraj Yes, it will. Just make sure that doing a json.loads() on this string should give you the desired output. The GA portal marks it as wrong unless I manually insert new lines. I hope that won’t be an issue, will it? Your markdown must have newline characters or spaces wherever necessary. Otherwise we will not be able to check if your answer is correct. Our parser will only work if encodings for the formatting are present in the response. If there are no encodings (invisible or visible) then we will not have the correctly formatted file. Please review module 1 for a better understanding about how text is encoded. Especially invisible characters. The browser is designed for user friendliness. Thats why the characters are invisible when you copy paste string with newlines. But it exists. The programmatic strings show invisible encodings as escaped characters. (Usually) To check if a string has invisible characters, # Multi-line string my_string = \"\"\"Hello World with spaces and some newlines and a tab \"\"\" # Print ASCII values of each character print([ord(c) for c in my_string]) e.g., newline = 10, tab = 9 This is a great way to check what we are receiving when you send us some response, import requests import json # This is just an example server to see what we see. url = \"https://httpbin.org/post\" my_multiline_string_answer = \"\"\"This is a multiline string that spans multiple lines with spaces and some newlines and a tab as well.\"\"\" response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = { \"answer\": my_multiline_string_answer } # Send the JSON data response = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator) # Check the response print (response.status_code) print (response.json ()) print (response.text) # Do other checks as necessary... See what happens when I print the result print (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer']) Screenshot 2025-03-27 at 1.09.56 pm323×120 3.61 KB Its a proper multiline correctly formatted text! The encodings are invisible just like in the original as well as in your clipboard when you copy paste into the GA. Here is a json example: json_answer = { \"mary\": \"poppins\", \"age\": 42 } stringed_json = json.dumps (json_answer) response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = { \"answer\": stringed_json } response = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator) print (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer']) Look at the response. A perfect json. If you do not want spaces in the response then strip the spaces before you send the stringified response. Kind regards I would request the TDS team to please consider making the evaluation criteria for project 2 a bit more liberal. 5 random Questions with 4 marks each is quite harsh. I request you to make it more balanced like 2 Qs from each GA with 2 marks each or so. So that even if we can’t exhaustively cover the whole number of questions, it gives mercy for the partial completion. 5 random question is a kind of lottery or luck based unless our app is perfect. Thanks @carlton @s.anand Hey guys, I have designed the code, and it currently works for the first 11 GA1 questions and the sixth and third questions of GA2. I have accounted for all edge cases. Please check the code at this link: https://4e52-43-230-106-58.ngrok-free.app/. Let me know your thoughts! @carlton , @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini GA2 - Question 3: Publish a Page Using GitHub Pages As part of the requirement, I successfully published a webpage using GitHub Pages that includes my email address 21f3001076@ds.study.iitm.ac.in in the HTML content. The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system. To automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page’s availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10–20 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process—from initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live—takes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine. However, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly—before the GitHub Pages site is actually live—resulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a 502 Bad Gateway error, likely due to Azure’s request timeout limitations. The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform’s allowed response duration. GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a 502 Bad Gateway error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure’s execution time limit. Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem. Currently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably. Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point. I am not certain if alternative platforms will work consistently across all questions, and making such a change could introduce failures in other parts of the assignment where Azure performs well. Below Image is showing response of local machine api request for GA2 Q3 which works fine. image1854×493 55.9 KB @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Final Thoughts on Project 2 Project 2 has been a valuable yet challenging experience. I’d like to share a few reflections—not as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations. Organization & Structure: The project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I’m not blaming anyone—just sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback. Deployment & Portal Limitations: There are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning. Time Constraints: Balancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments. Sessions & Support: The sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward. Deployment Variability: Each GA’s questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably. Effort Acknowledgment: I sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors—it’s clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it’s also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail—even the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment. Feasibility in the Given Timeline: Even for someone with a technical background, it’s difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn’t always feasible before the deadline. I genuinely hope someone is able to complete all 57 questions successfully—I’d love to learn from their experience and solutions. Again, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know—I’m happy to edit or delete the post if needed. Thank you for the learning opportunity I have implemented till GA 4 q8 with few questions here and there like one with the llamafile, etc. If someone have the functions of GA 5 ready please ping me for collaboration. @carlton How to do the GitHub Actions questions as it is a cron job based but need manual trigger for the eval script to verify. If done without cron job the portal complains. If there is any plan for extension, I request the TDS team to announce it in advance as people would rush and submit, then, they come hear about the extension when they had submitted it already. Happened to me like almost every time. We have OPPE this weekend, so if there is slightest possibility, I request to announce it in advance. Thanks @Saransh_Saini @carlton Can someone reply to this? WhatsApp Image 2025-03-27 at 13.41.43_5bd0a1821600×1069 246 KB Dear Sirs, I have a question regarding Q3 and Q4 of GA5. When calling the API, should we pass the .gz file directly, or will the API accept a Google Drive link from which it can download the .gz file? Specifically, will the API call be structured as follows? Essentialy, will the API call look like so? curl -X POST “http://127.0.0.1:5000” -H “Content-Type: multipart/form-data” -F \"question=Bandwidth Analysis for Regional Contents - anand.net is a personal website that had region-specific music content. One of the site’s key sections is tamilmp3, which hosts music files and is especially popular among the local audience. The website is powered by robust Apache web servers that record detailed access logs. These logs are essential for understanding user behavior, server load, and content engagement. By analyzing the server’s Apache log file, the author can identify heavy users and take measures to manage bandwidth, improve site performance, or even investigate potential abuse. Your Task: This GZipped Apache log file has 258,074 rows. Each row is an Apache web log entry for the site s-anand.net in May 2024. Each row has these fields: IP: The IP address of the visitor. Remote logname: The remote logname of the visitor. Typically ‘-’. Remote user: The remote user of the visitor. Typically ‘-’. Time: The time of the visit. E.g. [01/May/2024:00:00:00 +0000]. Note that this is not quoted, and you need to handle this. Request: The request made by the visitor. E.g. GET /blog/ HTTP/1.1. It has three space-separated parts: (a) Method: The HTTP method. E.g. GET. (b) URL: The URL visited. E.g. /blog/. (c) Protocol: The HTTP protocol. E.g. HTTP/1.1. Status: The HTTP status code. If 200 <= Status < 300, it is a successful request. Size: The size of the response in bytes. E.g. 1234. Referer: The referer URL. E.g. https://s-anand.net/. User agent: The browser used. This will contain spaces and might have escaped quotes. Vhost: The virtual host. E.g. s-anand.net. Server: The IP address of the server. The fields are separated by spaces and quoted by double quotes (‘-’). Unlike CSV files, quoted fields are escaped via \\\" and not ‘-’. (This impacts 41 rows.) All data is in the GMT-0500 timezone, and the questions are based on this same timezone. Filter the Log Entries: Extract only the requests where the URL starts with /tamilmp3/. Include only those requests made on the specified 2024-05-23. Aggregate Data by IP: Sum the ‘Size’ field for each unique IP address from the filtered entries. Identify the Top Data Consumer: Determine the IP address that has the highest total downloaded bytes. Report the total number of bytes that this IP address downloaded. Across all requests under tamilmp3/ on 2024-05-23, how many bytes did the top IP address (by volume of downloads) download?\" -F “file=@s-anand.net-May-2024.gz” I would appreciate your clarification on whether the .gz file should be directly included in the API request or if a Google Drive link should be provided instead. Thank you for your time and assistance. Hello Everyone i have cread solution now just for graded 1 and graded 2 a240-43-230-106-58.ngrok-free.app TDS - Tools for Data Science ask question there is only one problem in one question like in one question my code unable to match desired function so giving other function output The endpoint a240-43-230-106-58.ngrok-free.app is offline. Now Online check it is online so I have a doubt whatever output my code gives for the ga question , if i copy it one to one and paste in the ga page and it says correct .Would it mean the same would happen with the evaluation method ? or is there any extra things i must add? { “answer” : “answer inside string” } lakshaygarg654: GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a 502 Bad Gateway error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure’s execution time limit. Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem. @carlton I watched the last session. In that session, regarding the specific PDF question, you mentioned that the PDF is the same for everyone, so it can be preprocessed beforehand. However, I checked and found that the PDF is actually different for each user. So, we need to fetch it from the API endpoint. How should we handle the timeout issue on the deployment platform? I even tried upgrading the plan, but it didn’t help. @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj Also, many questions and doubts were addressed in the last two sessions. I can improve a lot and add the remaining questions, but the constraint is the 31st March deadline. Most students, including myself, will only get time after 30th March due to Viva and OPPE. It would be really helpful if the TDS team could extend the deadline. I believe it would strike a good balance—team made us wait for the Project 1 results, but extending the Project 2 deadline would make up for that for some extent. Its request nothing else. Hello sir, My question is, the questions my endpoint will be evaluated are they the exact same ones with same parameters for my respective email as on the assignment portal ? Essentially I am trying to understand there are certain questions where I don’t have to solve the question again and just return the hardcoded answers, would that be correct ? Anyone please respond and also for ga 1 q 8 for instance where we have: Let’s make sure you know how to use JSON. Sort this JSON array of objects by the value of the age field. In case of a tie, sort by the name field. Paste the resulting JSON below without any spaces or newlines. [{\"name\":\"Alice\",\"age\":67},{\"name\":\"Bob\",\"age\":53},{\"name\":\"Charlie\",\"age\":34},{\"name\":\"David\",\"age\":89},{\"name\":\"Emma\",\"age\":92},{\"name\":\"Frank\",\"age\":37},{\"name\":\"Grace\",\"age\":4},{\"name\":\"Henry\",\"age\":49},{\"name\":\"Ivy\",\"age\":30},{\"name\":\"Jack\",\"age\":2},{\"name\":\"Karen\",\"age\":2},{\"name\":\"Liam\",\"age\":5},{\"name\":\"Mary\",\"age\":32},{\"name\":\"Nora\",\"age\":56},{\"name\":\"Oscar\",\"age\":19},{\"name\":\"Paul\",\"age\":22}] Sorted JSON: here would question be sent as text only or text + json file seperately? Can Somebody please share the answers for GA 3 and 4, as I have missed those? Thank you @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Hi @adi3, The .gz file would be sent along with the API request. You can even read the file directly without even downloading it. The API request would be sent containing the question text and the JSON file/files as a binary stream. Hi @22f3002933 Files are less likely to change, but parameters are. For instance, GA1_Q12, the zip file is less likely to change but the symbols to perform the aggregate on would be changed. Hi @lakshaygarg654, Yes for GA4_Q9 the PDF files are different for everyone, but the workflow is exactly the same. Its a basic tabula read, with no particular need of any preprocessing. So, yeah you have to fetch it from the API request. Unfortunately, we can’t extend Project 2 deadline, it was released on 3rd of March, and we believe ample amount of time was given for it. If you are lagging far behind in the race, we would encourage you to collaborate with other and get the project done. Thanks for the answer sir. I remember being told on the last session, that the question will be exactly the same we have on the assignment portal for my respective case, and the answer on the portal can be the same here as well. Actually I am exploring a hardcoded answer route where if i return the answer which I already got after solving the questions on the portal (in certain qns with dynamic functions) , so thought of asking if method is alright. Yes sending your GA answer as text as the JSON response can work if the question was not parameterized. I hope you are aware that parameters for some questions will be changed, resulting in different answers. Thanks for your reply @Saransh_Saini I’ve figured out the solution to that particular question. The deadline is still a concern, as many issues were only resolved during recent sessions—similar to the project 1 workflow—and This time there are many other things in the pipeline ( viva’s and oppe’s ) Anyway, I will complete this course with valuable learnings, but many others have been seriously affected by it. Hi @Saransh_Saini @carlton , In the sample curl command i.e. curl -X POST \"https://your-app.vercel.app/api/\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\" \\ -F \"question=Download and unzip file abcd.zip which has a single extract.csv file inside. What is the value in the \"answer\" column of the CSV file?\" \\ -F \"file=@abcd.zip\" It is given that only one file arguement is passed , can there be a usecase where multiple files are sent , for example GA-5 10th question Image reconstruction where there could be one file be the image another could be separate file with mapping, Although mapping can be given with question as well, But still can you please confirm if there will be only one file or there can be multiple files send to API? Multiple files can be sent in the API requestion. They would be sent as a list of files. But in q10 will it be passed as the part of question only?? @carlton in GA 5 q10 the mappings table is sent as part of the question text or any other separate file? @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Query about Week2 Q3 and Q7 Publishing a page or action takes time to reflect the site or action performed in github. how to solve this timing issue ? Github repo creation and file /action addition completes immediately but publishing of file /action takes time causing the resulting URL to return 404 for a long time before it returns the correct 200 status and content in response. Hello Sir, I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to work on this project. I have developed a mini chatbot backend using vicky_server.py, which handles question matching and execution internally, producing appropriate responses. My mini chatbot is capable of creating its own API using REST and can manage tasks such as image compression, repository management, workflows, and web scraping related to graded assignments. It can even calculate total marks for subjects like physics and convert PDFs into markdown content. Additionally, it is capable of downloading the Llama model and creating a tunnel using ngrok. Essentially, it can address the first four assignment questions. However, there are some limitations to this project. Currently, it processes my local files instead of the uploaded PDFs. I am working on resolving this issue, but I have some confusion regarding the internal handling of uploaded files. When I pass a PDF or file through an upload method, how should the system proceed? I want to ensure that the file is treated as a PDF for the user rather than just being referenced as “question.pdf.” How can I effectively manage this problem? Furthermore, there is an issue with question matching. At times, the system incorrectly identifies questions containing the word “code” and executes first.py for GA1. Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project! Best regards, vicky kumar @s.anand @carlton @Saransh_Saini my model at Vicky kumar tds In GA5_Q10 the mappings would be sent as either a HTML or Markdown file along with the image. Both files would be send as a List. @carlton I am bit confused about answer evaluation process. Can you tell which one is correct process. 1st process ( I used json.dumps() to get my_response as json formatted string) image726×224 4.68 KB 2nd process ( This one is Json object) image514×193 3.61 KB or both are incorrect? This is one more example of 1st process after json.loads() it gave me correct format for assignment portal answer: image927×466 20.8 KB This is one more example of 2nd process without use of json.loads() it gave me correct format for assignment portal answer: image984×476 19.7 KB @Saransh_Saini @carlton @Jivraj The vercel api question in GA2, does the endpoint that we give you have to be a vercel url or just hosting it in anyway is alright? @Saransh_Saini the field name “file” would remain same, I mean it won’t be “files” right? I am trying to create a student account on Microsoft Azure using my IIT Madras email ID (23f2004705@ds.study.iitm.ac.in), but I am encountering an issue. The system is showing a message that my email domain is not currently registered with them, and it is asking me to use another verification method. @carlton @Jivraj Could you please guide me on how to proceed with the verification or if there is an alternative method to access Azure’s student benefits?

Carlton sir said he would post it. @carlton Hi @lakshaygarg654 In both the scenarios you laid out, the second implementation is correct. Your response to our API request should be a JSON object {\"answer\" : \"YOUR RESPONSE AS STRING\"}. In any case the value of the \"answer\" key should be a string. Hosting it anywhere is fine. Try to deploy on vercel first, if that doesn’t succeed you can use any other hosting technique. This is a basic prototype function we would be using to send requests to your URL. def run(question, file_path): url = \"http://127.0.0.1:8080/api\" questions = {'question': question} files = [ ('file', open(\"abcd.zip\", 'rb')), ('file', open(\"dcba.img\", 'rb')) ] response = requests.post(url, data=questions, files=files) return response or curl -X POST \"http://127.0.0.1:8080/api\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\" \\ -F \"question=question\" \\ -F \"file=@abcd.zip\" \\ -F \"file=@dcba.img\" NOTE: This is not the evaluation script. HI @ripusudan This has been a problem with all direct entry students. Unfortunately, there is no way we can help you with this problem. The best way out is asking a friend who is not a TDS student for this term to create a Azure VM for you. Yes the websites would be the same. Saransh_Saini: This is a basic prototype function we would be using to send requests to your URL. def run(question, file_path): url = \"http://127.0.0.1:8080/api\" questions = {'question': question} files = [ ('file', open(\"abcd.zip\", 'rb')), ('file', open(\"dcba.img\", 'rb')) ] response = requests.post(url, data=questions, files=files) return response I couldn’t find this function on the Project Doc and I made the project based on the curl function calling. Saransh_Saini: curl -X POST \"http://127.0.0.1:8080/api\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\" \\ -F \"question=question\" \\ -F \"file=@abcd.zip\" \\ -F \"file=@dcba.img\" At this moment it can’t be changed as I am occupied with other things. Please keep the question parameter as “question” and file parameter as “file” in the evaluation which is on the Project 2 page and the content type as multipart/form-data. To clarify if I can handle any one of these 2 methods, I will be fine? Edit: Just now discovered that the field names are indeed “question” and “file” only in both the cases. Sorry for the oversight. @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj I have a few queries. Even a yes/no response for each would suffice. GA1: Q13 - Use GitHub: Since the parameter is just my email, this question WILL NOT be tested against any other email, right? So I can just have a repo with my email in it, right? GA2: Q2 - Compress an image: Should my app’s response be like this { \"answer\": \"base64_encoding_of_compressed_image\" } Q3 - Host your portfolio on GitHub Pages, Q7 - Create a GitHub action, Q8 - Push an Image to Docker Hub: Similar to GA1 Q13, these too have my email or roll number as parameter. These too WILL NOT be checked against any other email, right? GA3: Can you please give an example of how questions of this GA will be sent in the request, especially any of Q1 or Q2 or Q5 or Q6 or Q7 or Q8 which have code-blocks containing text crucial to the question? I just want to decide whether regex or function-calling would be more appropriate here. GA4: The links to the website are hyperlinks in the questions. When the question will be sent to my app, will the link of the website to be scraped be written as a full link in the question itself or will it be sent in some other way? GA5: No particular questions at the moment. Please help me out by answering these asap if you use github student account then no need to verfiy this and you can directly verify through github student account and got credit i think 150 dollar so you can chose this path also Hello @22f3001307, there is an error in the code that needs to be fixed as part of the question: image = Image.open(list(files.upload().keys)[0] with image = Image.open(list(files.upload().keys())[0]) Sir but i am not a direct entry students @Saransh_Saini As per your reply time, I was in TDS session at that time. And asked same doubt, @Jivraj said 1st implementation they will use. Session link ( watch at 26:55) Kindly clarify this. What Jivraj agreed was stringifying the answer and putting it in as the value of the \"answer\" key in the JSON object. { \"answer\" : \"YOUR_STRINGIFIED_ANSWER\" } Just check the Project 2 page on the portal. It’s clearly mentioned a JSON object has to sent not a strigified version of the entire JSON object. image1022×277 11.6 KB @Jivraj kindly add-in your thoughts on this. Response from api should be a string, which if we load using json.loads it should load json object with answer key. 22f3000819: Q13 - Use GitHub: Since the parameter is just my email, this question WILL NOT be tested against any other email, right? So I can just have a repo with my email in it, right? Check with other student if they have a different email then it is a parameter and can change. 22f3000819: Q2 - Compress an image: Should my app’s response be like this { \"answer\": \"base64_encoding_of_compressed_image\" This is correct, make sure you test decoding base64 string before deadline. 22f3000819: Q3 - Host your portfolio on GitHub Pages, Q7 - Create a GitHub action, Q8 - Push an Image to Docker Hub: Similar to GA1 Q13, these too have my email or roll number as parameter. These too WILL NOT be checked against any other email, right? Same answer as Q13 GA1 22f3000819: Can you please give an example of how questions of this GA will be sent in the request, especially any of Q1 or Q2 or Q5 or Q6 or Q7 or Q8 which have code-blocks containing text crucial to the question? I just want to decide whether regex or function-calling would be more appropriate her We will take Q1 in this format, which is just copy pasting from portal``` One of the test cases involves sending a sample piece of meaningless text: au7BK3 33 H 5 lKz6y4n oQmbgoX 0 hNW3JH 68Q1u Write a Python program that uses httpx to send a POST request to OpenAI’s API to analyze the sentiment of this (meaningless) text into GOOD, BAD or NEUTRAL. Specifically: Make sure you pass an Authorization header with dummy API key. Use gpt-4o-mini as the model. The first message must be a system message asking the LLM to analyze the sentiment of the text. Make sure you mention GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL as the categories. The second message must be exactly the text contained above. This test is crucial for DataSentinel Inc. as it validates both the API integration and the correctness of message formatting in a controlled environment. Once verified, the same mechanism will be used to process genuine customer feedback, ensuring that the sentiment analysis module reliably categorizes data as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. This reliability is essential for maintaining high operational standards and swift response times in real-world applications. Note: This uses a dummy httpx library, not the real one. You can only use: response = httpx.get(url, **kwargs) response = httpx.post(url, json=None, **kwargs) response.raise_for_status() response.json() [quote=\"22f3000819, post:173, topic:169029\"] The links to the website are hyperlinks in the questions.

Thanks for the help @Jivraj sir Dear Sir Is there any limite for request on tokens. because now my model does not generate any output. for any question also not showing any error. could you please explain. When i hit request on this (curl -X POST “http://localhost:8000/api/” -H “Content-Type: multipart/form-data” -F \"question=Let’s make sure you can write formulas in Google Sheets. Type this formula into Google Sheets. (It won’t work in Excel) =SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 1, 9), 1, 10)) What is the result?\") this is not showing any kind of output or error not only on this request any other also. As per the portal, we have to return a JSON object as a response from the API. However, if we load a JSON object directly using json.load(), it will throw an error. We need to first convert it into a JSON string and then load it using json.loads( ). For clarity I add image below. This question has been stretched for too long—it’s not that big. I guess @Jivraj is right. image562×700 23.4 KB @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Hi, while trying to creating podman image of my application, it is being created as 7.2GB file. Any idea what should i do? Also, I can sign up for azure student pack, are there any way to deploy my application? Thanks Subject: Request for Uniform Evaluation Process in Project 2 - TDS Solver. Hello @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini sir. We truly appreciate the effort you put into designing and evaluating our graded assignments and projects. We understand that any five random questions will be selected for evaluation, and we fully respect this approach. However, we kindly request that the same set of five questions be used for all students to ensure a uniform and unbiased evaluation process. This way, the difficulty level remains consistent across all evaluations, providing a fair assessment of our understanding. Thank you for considering our request. We appreciate your guidance and support. Best regards, Digvijaysinh Chudasama. image698×405 17.4 KB For this question, The answer which we get is not same as the expected answer which the portal fetch through proxy fetch image733×201 38.2 KB let h = await fetch('/proxy/…) ------------> here @Jivraj @carlton sir because of this mismatch we have to edit manually after clicking check button again and again please guide me how to solve this @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj I just wanted to bring to your attention that in GA4 question 2, the answer evaluation script expects the movie title as “17. Kraven: The Hunter” but it is actually listed on the IMDb page as “17. Kraven the Hunter”, resulting in the correct one being marked wrong. No questions here just wanted to bring it to attention so that it does not affect the project evaluation script. Its unusual to have a docker container worth 7 GBs of space. Here is what you can do Remove unused libraries from your requirements.txt. Sometimes having resource demanding libraries like SentenceTransformers can install large sub-dependency packages. Exclude your virtual environment folder from the container creation Create a .containerignore file to have an exception for those folders you want to skip. Clear your package cache and any vscode cache you might have. Hi @21f2000588, Your concerns sound genuine and we will put this point up during our discussion sessions. Whatever would be the decision we will inform you guys. Regards, Saransh Saini In the previous replies, you’ve mentioned that for Github questions → actions, pages (GA2) that if the email changes for everyone it means that its parameterised. However, in one of the live sessions this week, Carlton had mentioned that for these questions, it wont be parameterised as this is very individual specific. The same goes for the docker hub question of GA2 as well. KIndly clarify on the same. For GA2 Q9 → I have given an input file via post request and my fastapi server can handle get requests and its as follows. Kindly confirm if my url is good to go for this specific question. image1932×1748 225 KB @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Sir, in GA4 Question 7, the portal gives the boundary of ultra-new user as the exact time when it was opened, right? image1602×275 34.1 KB So, will this boundary for ultra-new user be sent as parameter in the question or can my app use datetime.now() to set the ultra-new user boundary? Hi @22f3000819 Thanks for bringing this into light, we’ll keep this in mind while creating the evaluation script. This will be sent as a parameter in along with the API request. Okay sure, thank you so much. I hope you take this into consideration.

However, due to the heavy confusion among students and will be considering responses with entire JSON objects stringified. We don’t want anyone to loose their marks for such a miniscule error. So, \"{\\\"answer\\\": \\\"YOUR_ANSWER\\\"}\" is also valid. means {‘answer’:‘E://data science too//GA5/output/vicky.jpg’} right or we have to do you said output as base64 @Algsoch We should receive your images as base64 encoded within your response JSON object. No, we won’t be able to access your images from your local machine address. i cannot use github as file goes to 18gb what is solution for it as you are asking for github but i created repo there is only main file vicky_server.py,copy_tds.py can you explain how to solve this problem and i will use ngrok so we have to open that till you check and how i know that you will check my api that time or when as vercel don’t supported it @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj @carlton Sir, I have an issue in GA5 Q3 What is the number of successful GET requests for pages under /telugu/ from 11:00 until before 20:00 on Mondays? For this, I have used two python scripts to get the answer, one written completely by me and another from someone else’s solution; both give the same answer - 2698 However, the portal says it’s incorrect. No modifications resulting in different answer are being accepted either and the modifications themselves seem to break the bounds of the question.

The circumstances this time have been more challenging than in Project 1, making it difficult to meet the deadline. We would be extremely grateful if you could consider this request. Your support would be highly appreciated. Thank you for your time and consideration. Best regards Yes please extend the deadline for project 2, as it was very lengthy and we have other exams as well with that. @s.anand , @carlton @Jivraj , @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @carlton Respected Sirs, Please consider the extension for Project 2 submission… Good morning sir, Could you please extend the deadline for Project 2 as today(31/03/2025) is the last day of submission and it clashes with “Eid al-Fitr”. I have small portion of work left but it won’t be possible as there is frequent visit of guests and friends. Could you please extend the deadline till 02/04/2025, this will give us enough amount of time to complete the project after our festival. Thank you @carlton, please this much support we deserve from you Pls sir extend the deadline it’s very hectic schedule for all of us to complete by today. @Jivraj @carlton @s.anand Sir, could you please extend the deadline by one day? I’m facing some issues with deployment, and with Eid celebrations at home, it’s been a bit difficult to manage everything. I would really appreciate your consideration. Thank you! @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj @s.anand Sir many of us had OPPEs and Programming projects due this weekend and thus an extension in the deadline will be helpful hi sir. Im also on the same boat. hello please say on ngrok i want to share ngrok method ‘’ but i have to open all days right on Hi. I got a new laptop and was wondering how to recover my AIPROXY token. How do I get it? If I remember correctly it has something to do with my iiim email @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj @carlton What is the request timeout for each question, especially for the question on YouTube video transcription? I request the timeout to be at least 40-60 seconds as yt-dlp and faster-whisper take take to download the audio, load the model and run it on cpu and get the transcription. For 259.7 to 351.8 seconds, it is taking around 1.5 mins, but it is giving the correct answer. So I request you to shorten the length of the audio or increase the request timeout or both in moderation. Question —> the “question” sent to the api will have the youtube video link, right? Or since the video is same for everyone, can I just have the audio file ready in the project? Will the api be tested against any YouTube video other than the Mystery Story Audiobook link given in the GA question? Edit: Even with a preprocessed audio file (mp3, speech optimized, 32K), what’s taking the longest time is joining the transcribed sentences into a single string. That alone is taking >50 seconds. Please suggest a way to make it faster. Regards, Shivaditya For the FastAPI type questions, my endpoints are like http://ip:port/endpoint. But while testing using the portal it expects HTTPS instead of http. But nothing of that sort is given in the question. Will the evaluator also expect a https url or is a http url enough for it to hit the endpoint? @Saransh_Saini @carlton @Jivraj Yes we’ll take that into consideration. For GA 5 - Q10 - do we have to return base64 encoded image or the url of the image? Base64 encoded string @Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini q-vercel-python.json will be same or different? image1548×391 39.2 KB Will the llamafile be same? image780×221 21.5 KB hello i want to know about this currently I am using approach like you provide HTML page URL and my internal approach and run hidden value or you provide URL website image788×325 9.21 KB hello for this question i am using approach like initially i login and saved seession now it is giving output like it login internally to website of college ga1 and then find image974×281 14.5 KB I asked this question in the gmeet.

Respected Sir, I kindly request a deadline extension of at least 3 minutes for the project submission, similar to what was done for ROE. Due to slow internet connectivity and the absence of WiFi, my submission took longer than usual. As a result, I was only able to upload it at 12:01 AM instead of the regular 11:59 PM deadline. PLEASE Sir, As I’m a standalone student and this is my primary degree after 12th, please do accept it. Thank you tom1000×750 328 KB sir kindly extend the deadline for a day sir, kind request from tds students. kindly consider our pleadings. sir i was trying to upload it but due to net issue it got submitted at 12:01. the google form is saying the response is recorded. so my response is recorded right?

While we understand your reasons, we kindly request you to consider our situation as well. Hi @carlton @Jivraj I have submitted my fastapi endpoint without the /api at the end. Would this be a problem? @carlton @Jivraj @s.anand Sir i also didn’t addd /api/ at the end of the url. Will this cause a peoblem? My project is hosted on render, because vercel refuses to cooperate with me, as a result the free version of render takes a minute to respond, and not only that but might also give internal server error until the 2nd or 3rd try. There is nothing I can do to change this except for maybe sending requests every now and then like it was suggested for another student using render. I just want to know if this is okay for evaluation. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini sir, I also have submitted my fastapi endpoint without /api at the end, please reply if this would be a problem? @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand Can you please say when the project 2 be evaluated?? since i am using ngrok it is very hard to keep my laptop running and also the result time is given as 15th. no possile way i could run my laptop more than a couple day. kindly provide a solution for ngrok users or please extended a day or so to change from ngrok to someother. this is a kind request. and kindly reply as soon as possible. me too ,please inform how long will it take . are we free to edit the google response , to update the ngrok link if it changes cuz in the free version if the laptop restarts so will the link @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand Yesterday, I don’t mention /api at the end of my dns while submitting the form and I come to know to day we have to add /api at the end of the it. So I edited my response please consider the latest one. @carlton @Jivraj I have a curious question. I have my project running from azure and code in GitHub repository. What is stopping me from making further change to my deployment because my end point will be same. Anyway my code checksum for the deployment and GitHub code won’t match as I haven’t pushed the token to GitHub. Thanks, Vinil I did the same mistake and I am just realising it. Will my submission be discarded in that case? Please clarify. @carlton @Jivraj I reuesting to all my teachers @s.anand, @carlton, @Jivraj, @Saransh_Saini please reply me. What is this going on? Is it joking? Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don’t think so that they really made any effort in our course. In project-2 also, we need solutions for all graded assignments and so many students request for solutions but our the great teachers ignores the request and didn’t provide the solutions. I think they provide the projects whatever comes in their dreams during sleeping. In weekly study material, don’t have their notes, even they have a very few videos made by them, they just render to other YouTuber’s Youtube videos and online websites. Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything. Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \". I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. But on extending the deadline of project-2 just only for one day, their evaluation will be late. In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. It is our tales it is my right to get solutions for every weekly assignment, but don’t ask them to make efforts. Just pay and do assignments at own risk even you have not understand anything from the copy-pasted material. Just use AI’s or read whatever and wherever you want to read. It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term. Thankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’. hi, I dont share your views. i feel it was one of the best course in whole of Diploma. I have learned a lot in these projects and even in ROE preparation. all the things we are learning here are open in market and the course contents are great direction towards learning and practicing them. I agree it is stessful, my whole team were in a 9-hour g-meet call on Saturday night. but we have found solutions, shared ideas, try-outs, made fun of each other. but at the end of the day we all agree that we have learnt lots of new things. Regarding Project1 delay: if we think, atleast 1GB of docker image per students for 700+ students. even if parallalize the execution 5 students at a time you still need a very powerfull system to download and amount of data downloading etc… At the end of the day we got a very good result and report with logs to verify for GA’s: it is upto you to copy solutions or learn something out of each GA sections All in all I am happy with the course. Totally Agree with @23f2004837 Best course so far from learning POV. Dear Shahzada, You joined Discourse almost a year ago Jun 8th, 2023. In all that time you have read 832 posts. And never interacted with anyone on discourse. You finally decided to interact once and that was today and this is your first post (your second if we count that you deleted your first post) The first step to receiving help is communication. If you do not communicate, no one can help you. 23f2002668: What is this going on? Is it joking? I am not sure what your question is. I am not sure what you are referring to. Please be clear in your questions. 23f2002668: Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? We have made several hours of videos on Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself. 23f2002668: I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. Not sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared) 23f2002668: They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? Yes these were explained if you either took part in any live session or watched the recorded video 23f2002668: And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? I am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks. 23f2002668: It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Project 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words: Create a server api that receives a request. The request would be any question from the first 5 GAs. The response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page. Multiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions. 23f2002668: Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? Since this is your first post, you’ve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process. If you want solutions, there are several options: Ask for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it) Collaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration) Join live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked) Watch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment) 23f2002668: They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. This is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting. The biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs… with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning. 23f2002668: Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. If you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video. But feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up. What are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that. I absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you. 23f2002668: They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything. Reading documentation is a skill you have to pick up. Having said that, we have always explained something that students have asked. Just ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world. Now is a good time to start. 23f2002668: Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \" That is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic. 23f2002668: I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? They have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time. Luckily for you, our first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be). 23f2002668: The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. If you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion. 23f2002668: In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. Anand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution? Also if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script. But validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime. You can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback. 23f2002668: It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term. Thankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’. I am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither respect nor kindness is evident in your post. But thank you for your feedback. One final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score. And when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve. Kind regards, TDS team Hi, I have a few things to say My background : I have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term. My Initial Disappointments with this Course In one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction): The video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended. Here, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn’t like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph ROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful. There are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily. Why did I fail? Last Term I dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn’t practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon. This term. I made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn’t allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn’t submit both the projects. In both the terms I didn’t collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn’t earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair. Me Understanding about the Course Now This one line changed my view about ROE. On another topic What does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning. I am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don’t know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough. I scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS. Now I realize that I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time. In MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing SKLearn. Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE. This course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an implicit way. This is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code. I have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks I have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc. I am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt. From the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn’t do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn’t cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects. Since this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too. Thanks to @s.anand , @carlton , @Jivraj and @Saransh_Saini Just two suggestions I feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites. While introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained. Also, address few questions in the video itself which are likely to be asked by us. true but I wish they can inform how quickly they can evaluate for those using paid platforms / ngrok @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Hello Carlton, When are you guys likely to test the API endpoints for Project 2? I have hosted it on Microsoft Azure, and I only have $92 left out of the free $100 credit. It would be great if you could do this within a week. It is decreasing rapidly. @carlton @Saransh_Saini same issue I only have $80 left out of the free $100 credit. It would be great if you could do this within a week. @parthivn28 @Harshjayswal-2003 @23f2004912 Evaluations will start before this weekend, with some sampling done possibly even tonight and most evaluation runs tomorrow. Also we will prime the target first by sending a dummy request so it gets “warmed up” because some of you have reported time to respond to first request takes time for the server to spin up. Then once we know its responding, we will send requests for evaluation. Kind regards @carlton lord carlton Yess, I too did the same , previously submitted on 11.55 and edited my response on 12.01 with /api . Hope u will consider it . @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj hello can you share ip address whenever you hit our api then we know you hitting it please @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand sir, I have noticed that sometimes our vm based application gets stuck and on verifying every request using FastApi have noticed that best way to check is run and get your answer post that RESET it back and then run another query and it works perfectly fine, not sure have other faced this issue or not, but it would be great if you could take note of this while evaluating just for safety. Hope you take note of this and take this into consideration. Thanks & Regards, Digvijaysinh Chudasama @carlton @Jivraj @s.anand yes same issue @carlton @Jivraj @s.anand Sirs, I too am facing this issue.. 21f2000588: check is run and get your answer post that RESET it back and then run another query I couldn’t get what this part means? Okay so basically sometimes what happens is while verifying on FASTApi – it gives errors like missing paramaters like… So basically sometimes it needs resetting the request parser and then it works perfectly fine. { \"detail\": \"execute() missing 1 required positional argument: 'file_bytes'\" } Which is incorrect, so if we press the RESET button and execute it works properly. image1775×721 21.8 KB Correct output image – image1806×235 10.1 KB Hope you get my point which i’m trying to convey sir. @23f2004912 Just a brother trying to help students gain valuable skills. Nothing more brother. The success of students’ future, is the best reward. Sometimes it takes a bit longer because some lessons are harder than others. And we all make mistakes. But if you’ve learnt something valuable on the journey, then you are better prepared for what comes next regardless of whether you could clear the obstacle the first time or not. Kindest regards, Just Carlton (nothing more). The way we test your api is not through a front end. We send a request to the endpoint directly. We have demoed it in live sessions. We have even posted on discourse snippets of what this looks like. As long as your endpoint responds to a request that we send, it will be fine. Kind regards sir @carlton currently iam facing an issue sir. just now in order check weather my api is working fine or not . i just tried curl some question but unexpectedly i got timeout error from vercel. i have deployed my app in vercel only. when i checked out i found that in vercel for free account the request timeout is 10s. what to do sir some times gpt take more time to respond. The same endpoint after an hour i tried works fine . will this be an issue sir . @carlton i also edited my form due to /api/ after deadline on monday can u tell atleast whats the status on this query Dear @Carlton and @S.Anand, I successfully deployed my project on Vercel, and it works perfectly when tested using curl commands. Each task installs its required packages and runs as expected. However, I encountered an issue with Vercel’s free version, which has a 250MB limit. While my project’s size without installed packages is approximately 34MB, the size exceeds the limit once packages like Pandas, NumPy, Pillow, Whisper, and Uvicorn are installed, causing the server to crash. Could you kindly suggest any alternatives or solutions for this issue? I would greatly appreciate your guidance, as I fear all my hard work might go to waste without a resolution. We are in the processing pipeline. You will have to wait till it completes. Basically if your endpoint works when we send it a request you will be evaluated. We will use the timestamp of your latest endpoint before the deadline. Hope that answers your question. The alternative is to use vercel purely as an endpoint service that processes most things without large libraries, and for more heavy duty backend work forwards the request to another system that handles it and sends it back to your vercel function which then relays the answer to the request. in spreadsheet edit response modify previous response with timestamp, how you can access that timestamp response?? So how can u have my end point before deadline one since i updated it after deadline. Also the before deadline one end point is /api which i changed to /api/ after deadline so if u somehow have access to my old url pls consider adding 1 (slash) / :') gform allows multiple submissions. i would have to check with @s.anand if its been enabled, i almost certain he has configured it for multiple submissions. I understand your point but what I am saying is that when I edited my end point after deadline it changed my timestamp to after deadline one so that is my concern that my submission might not be even considered you can have multiple submissions with multiple timestamps in gform. (unless you chose to edit your response, in that situation i have not tested what actually happens). I have edited after deadline from /api to /api/ I did not resubmit : From Problem to Platform: Building “Vicky” – A Smart Data Science Assistant for TDS @ IIT Madras Project Demo Website: https://app.algsoch.tech During our college course Tool for Data Science (TDS) at IIT Madras, we were tasked with a challenging but exciting project: to build a platform that can take in natural language questions and execute corresponding solutions through an API. The Mission: Create a tool that behaves like a chatbot, accepts user queries (text or file-based) via web or API, processes them intelligently, executes the appropriate code, and returns accurate results—like a real data science assistant. The Journey: From Fails to Final At first, the natural choice was to try LLM agents—they sounded magical. But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries. Then I thought—what if I manually mapped questions and answers using a static JSON structure? That quickly broke when users passed different parameters, different files, or queried in non-standard formats like “code -s” or “code -v”. The next idea: write individual Python scripts per question from our Graded Assignments (GA1–GA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable. The Breakthrough: Dynamic Function Mapping After multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture: Centralized engine in vicky_server.py Uses regex-based pattern matching to detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solution Each solution is a structured Python function like ga1_first_solution(query=None) Supports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and more Acts like a mini compiler for data science tools Presenting Vicky – The Mini Chatbot for TDS Vicky is a smart, modular chatbot built specifically for Tool for Data Science at IIT Madras. It’s packed with real functionality—not just templates. Key Features: Graded Assignment Solver Handles dynamic, real-world questions from GA1 to GA5 like: code -s / code -v → VS terminal commands Create FastAPI API for CSV with filtering/searching GitHub automation: repo creation, GitHub Actions setup Data cleaning, scraping from IMDb, image compression File Upload with Query Matching Users can upload a file (CSV, JSON, Excel) and ask file-specific queries. The system understands context and dynamically links the query to the uploaded file. HTML Viewer + Base64 Decoder View any website in rendered & source format using CORS proxy Upload Base64 string → Get original image back Webhooks Integration Live notifications via Discord & Slack whenever /api endpoints are accessed Monitors server status (online/offline) and sends real-time updates LLM Download + Auto Tunneling Downloads LLaMA models Dynamically finds available ports Creates and exposes tunneled endpoints Live Web UI at app.algsoch.tech Ask any TDS question Upload and query with files Image decoder Graded assignment slider navigation HTML viewer API health status Built With: FastAPI for blazing fast APIs Regex & Pattern Matching for dynamic input detection GitHub Copilot + my Python debugging and architectural thinking Full webhook and status monitoring system Modular backend (vicky_server.py) and web frontend (vicky_app.py) I want to extend a huge thank you to @s.anand for their guidance on this project. I’ve learned what prompt engineering is and how we can leverage large language models (LLMs). One interesting takeaway is that while these technologies won’t replace our jobs—especially for those who understand programming—they will create new job opportunities instead. Now I am capable of how fastapi work and more things and how to structure code and how to design code and most important what to think for project Dear Sir, I would like to clarify the situation regarding my previous submission. Initially, I provided an ngrok link, but due to an error with ngrok, it stopped working. I then found an alternative solution using Cloudflare with a custom domain that I obtained through the GitHub Student Pack. I successfully created a tunnel, and it is currently functional. I can shut down my laptop, and it still works with the same URL when I restart. I hope you will consider my case. I submitted my work at that time because I learned about this solution from a fellow student on Discord. I only changed the URL and made no other modifications. Thank you for your understanding Hi @carlton The same issue has affected several of us. During the last Google Meet session, we explained the situation to @Saransh_Saini. It seems that when we edit our responses, the timestamp with other values updates not submitted as new response. However, the position of the response in the form remains unchanged. For instance, we submitted our response at 11:30 PM on March 31st, and someone else submitted theirs at 11:45 PM. Even after editing our response the next day, our entry still appears above theirs. We just wanted to clarify: Will responses edited or submitted on April 1st still be considered, given that the form remains open? If not, is there any way we can show proof of our original submission? Currently, we have email confirmations for both the initial and the edited responses. We hope this won’t be a major issue, especially not on the level of Project 1 concerns. Looking forward to a positive resolution from the TDS team. Thank you Lakshay Dear @carlton @s.anand Sir “I’ve deployed my project to Microsoft Azure through GitHub, and my Azure for Students account was verified today. Could you kindly review this project instead of the previous link I shared? While I did not make any changes to the code, you can access and review it directly on GitHub.” My Azure credits are burning out. It is giving me unwanted pressure.

Now what exactly have I edited is just added a “/” at the end and that’s it and nothing more. Highlighting it again, I haven’t resubmitted the form but edited it on the very next morning after the deadline. So now my question is: My edited response will be accepted right in this case? Sir, please throw some light on my doubt. Warm Regards, Tensed TDS Student @carlton . Hi sir, I also edited the form after deadline. I just added /ask in the end… any update on this would be appreciated @carlton @Jivraj I would like to clarify something, I had gotten a couple of get requests on my ngrok api endpoint .(but I had set it up for post req as per the P2 details) .Wanted to know if this is requests from ur side.

These include IPs from places like New York (162.243.238.100), London (34.89.64.89), Amsterdam (45.148.10.172), Moscow (84.201.151.18), Jaipur (103.175.163.104), and Vilnius (85.255.108.243). It really seems like automated vulnerability scanning or botnet activity. Carlton, what can I do?? Several students have made the exact same problem. We are looking into it. The evaluation script is ready and the evaluations are going on. So have no worries, your $75 are enough to carry out several evaluations.

These issues are beyond our control and I request the TDS team to please consider this issue and please consider re-evaluating it if it has not been done yet as we had put in a lot of efforts. i havent recieved any pings yet . Has it pinged everyone or is it still coming batch by batch Now my token is expired? They revoked token access? My env only shut down its running again lol You have used 11 requests this month (2025-04), costing 0.01 USD. so maybe you guys have not hit my server yet im guessing 154.81.156.35:57962 this ip keeps pinging , is this the teams? @carlton @Jivraj Just do a geographic search on the ip Even am getting random requests from US,Netherlands, Singapore etc… what might be the reason Hi @23f1002382 I re-ran evaluation on your endpoint, and it completed successfully. They are malicious probes. A global cyber war is going on. So anything that can be compromised is being probed. @carlton sir A lot of us have hosted on Azure and other platforms and were wondering by when we could expect project 2 marks so that we can take this down ? Could we have rough idea as to when the results will be available ? @Carlton, I believe you all have evaluated it. For me, there are some requests from a known IP with the following location details: {'status': 'success', 'country': 'India', 'countryCode': 'IN', 'region': 'TN', 'regionName': 'Tamil Nadu', 'city': 'Chennai', 'zip': '600042', 'lat': 13.0895, 'lon': 80.2739, 'timezone': 'Asia/Kolkata', 'isp': 'IIT Madras', 'org': 'IITM', 'as': 'AS141340 IIT Madras', 'query': '103.158.43.17'} This request was made at 4:38:19 IST.

I just checked my logs, it seems like we ran evaluation on your endpoint, but it looks like your server wasn’t running. But i tried and its working can you let me know what I can do? image1337×754 55.1 KB image1914×292 40.3 KB I have been doing this the entire day even yest and getting the output. Can you please check again It seems like your server went offline for some reason when we ran evaluations on it. Keep your server running for the next 2 hours, we’ll run a re-evaluation. Yes sure thank you so much. It is running right now @Saransh_Saini The same thing happened to me. I have not received request from Indian ip as far as I can see on the logs. Can you please check if my server responded or not ? I am using Google cloud and the VM was running continuously… I just now checked it ran! all 5 qs thank you so much! Your submission was complete successfully. Even your score card has been generated. Thank you so much sir… @Saransh_Saini - This is 24f1001631 The same thing has happened to me as the mentioned above. I also have not received request from Indian IP as far as I can see on the logs. I am using the azure VM itself. I rechecked and maybe the server went offline, so I re-ran the script anyway and checked a few questions now and it works. I think after a certain while it timed out for me(not entirely sure tho)… but i fixed it. ga1 q1 image1378×866 65 KB ga5 q5 image1384×644 48 KB @Saransh_Saini Hi sir, can you check and say if my server has been evaluated? roll no.23f3000975 thank you in advance Yes you have been evaluated. You have been evaluated @ItsMeAlex Thanks Saransh. PS: Just wanted to know how did u automate the testing of something like this?(Postman?) Create a shell script that loops through the list of API endpoints and uses curl to send requests to each. You can pass headers, authentication tokens, or data as needed. @Saransh_Saini Hi sir, just wanted to know when will the results be released. And also in the image I attached it I think shows five different scores for each questions you asked through curl. Is that the mark for each questions and total mark should be considered? also want to know if we need to do any extra projects for the bonus marks. thank you 10000831091920×1446 286 KB i am running via ngrok , and have recieved no pings yet please check This Makes sense. Thanks. please send complete screenshot .. @Saransh_Saini and @carlton sir .. Please check my link sir and please use http instead of https , I have submitted the link correctly …Kindly co-operate.. Postman can’t be used for automation. Had to write a script for the entire process. @Saransh_Saini I see a lot of 308’s as status codes in the logs I can see on render. Could you let me know if testing of my project was successful? Or if I did something wrong? My roll number is 21f2001573. (A hint on my score would be welcome. ^_^) can u please check 23f3001787 as i havent recieved any hits on my ngrok logs Thanks lol maybe i wont fail XD. But really thanks Lol that question was only right for you XD @Saransh_Saini Sir can you please check 24f2000940? @Saransh_Saini could you please give indication of how long we should keep the server running? Is it ok to shut those down now or will more evaluations be conducted? You have been evaluated. Your app crashed during the initial evaluation. But the re-run was successful. @Jivraj sir could you please check for 24f2003130… Today’s morning there was a glitch in my vercel…but I think since it was after evaluation it shouldn’t have impacted that…could you please verify it once @Saransh_Saini a gentle reminder. You have been successfully evaluated thank you , so I can shut my ngrok session now right Keep it running for the next hour, have to generate your report/ @Saransh_Saini Hello sir, can you please say when can we expect results to be published? . Also we would like to know still how much time or days should our server be running? Thankyou in advance can you share your email id will I know if its done generating ? @saransh_saini @carlton Can we kindly expect the result for Project 2 today? No, but we’ll release the first batch soon. Hello @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj Could you please share an update on the expected results for P2? Also, could you confirm whether my evaluation has been completed? Additionally, when would it be safe to stop the VM, as it is consuming a significant amount of credits? Looking forward to your response. Thanks and Regards. @Saransh_Saini is my evaluated yet? lemme know due to credit on azure need to check them also. Hello, I wanted to provide an update regarding the issue I faced while I was in Jammu. During my stay, my laptop was on, but I encountered an error that caused my endpoint to crash. It seemed that Cloudflared mentioned needing an update, which I believe contributed to the problem. Now that I’m back in Delhi, I’m connected to the internet, and I’m happy to report that my endpoint is working again. see this image I have designed my endpoint to monitor with discord webhook image1543×875 50.7 KB Its done @parthivn28 thank you for the swift response Hey @Saransh_Saini , can you please confirm if my report was created or not so that I can turn off the vm on azure if it has been done already. Thank you again! Hi @Saransh_Saini Hope you’re doing well. If the evaluation process has been completed, kindly let us know so that we can stop the Azure Web App service.

Yes, @21f2000709 Your entire evaluation has been completed, along with your report generation. You may shutdown your VM. HARISH.S: 23f3000975 @Saransh_Saini Sir, is my evaluation and project report generation completed.? can i also close the server? my roll no.23f3000975 @Saransh_Saini Sir, I saw from the logs on Cloud Run that my project was probably evaluated on 5th April at around 11:51 PM and all the requests made during that time resulted in 3 response status codes: 302, 307 and 405 by no fault of my app, but rather errors in the request itself. I mentioned the exactly correct URL of my app in the form but the evaluation logs show three different types of URL to which request was made. As I mentioned in the form, my url is of the format “https://…/api/” and allows only POST requests. The app was supposed to allow POST requests and I allowed only POST requests, so GET requests even to correct url resulted in 405 response When POST requests were actually made, two wrong urls were used for all the POST requests a. http://…/api/ → resulted in 302 response b. https://…/api → resulted in a 307 whereas the url I gave was of the format “https://…/api/” The logs from Cloud Run image982×552 133 KB As you can see from the above logs, all POST requests made to my app have the wrong url, some have only http and some end with “/api” instead of “/api/”, both of which do not match with the correct url I gave in the Google Form (screenshot attached below). image831×645 41.7 KB I request you to re-evaluate my project 2 with the correct url exactly as I had submitted in the Google Form. Thank you. Regards, Shivaditya @Saransh_Saini One more thing—could you please clarify whether the evaluation process includes both types of responses mentioned in post number 202? You have been evaluated. You have been evaluated, successfully. @Saransh_Saini Have I been evaluated? My roll number is 21f2001573. @Saransh_Saini Is my project evaluation done yet? my Roll no.: 24f1002555 @Saransh_Saini Hi sir, when will be project 2 results released for all? Thanks, Sujay D My IITM student dashboard on the portal shows absent for course project (COURSE PROJET - Absent). Is this referring to project 1 or 2? Coz i missed Project 1 but submitted Project 2 successfully. Also the logs show that the evaluation was performed on the submitted enpoint. So should I be concerned about the dashboard showing ‘Absent’ or will it be updated in a few days? Hello @Saransh_Saini can you please confirm if my report was created or not so that I can turn off the vm on azure if it has been done already. @Saransh_Saini when can expect result today or tomorrow or later? Probably in 2 days time assuming no problems or other unforseen errors occur. @Carlton @Saransh_Saini, it would be helpful if you could specify a date — a clear deadline We cant specify a clear deadline. If we could we would. At the present time there are roughly 100+ evals left in the pipeline. And we retry them to give students the best chance of getting a score. Sometimes we accomodate some unusual situations that we have been made aware of but all of those interrupt our workflows and so it takes time. Which makes this process a little unpredictable. This is the first term where we have had students deploy solutions that require significant compute resources on our end to evaluate. So there was always going to be hickups. But i think that we have delivered an equally enriching learning experience as a result which is enough to land you an actual job. (Might not be so enriching on your CGPA admittedly, but thats a small price to pay for invaluable skills you hopefully have gained) @carlton Could you clarify if some kind of a normalisation will be done this time as well? Or if some bonus marks will be given? Last time, it didn’t help as much because the highest marks were 16. Normalisation is only helpful when no one scores the top marks. It will be similar in case the top cumulative score after the ET is, say, 90… @carlton @Saransh_Saini @carlton Please can you tell me whether my evaluation is done or not. For roll no: 22f2000946 If yes, I will stop my VM. I am running low on credits. We will complete evaluation in two days. We will also send out a mail today for those whose evaluation has been completed sir i am unable to work with other things on my laptop image712×574 6.41 KB because laptop giving error because my system ran out of memory and because api working continuously more than 1 week @carlton @Saransh_Saini This is a gentle reminder to kindly send the confirmation email indicating for whom the evaluation of Project 2 has been completed. Additionally, I would like to confirm whether we can shut down our Azure VM after this, or if we should keep it running in case there is an additional evaluation. In one of the sessions, you had mentioned the possibility of offering alternate questions as a second chance for students, evaluated at half the original marking scheme (i.e., 2 marks per question). image2342×990 233 KB Hello @Saransh_Saini , @Jivraj Sir When i test it locally , my LLM is working fine , even running the app , it gave result in 2 sec , I dont know what happened in the logs , it was showing some runtime error , As i am using free plan of vercel , so it allow for 10 sec only , I think any heavy file being run , so it just take some more time , more than 10 sec , but inbuild feature of free plan allow to run only 10 sec … and thats why this happened , i guess does it means , my LLM failed ?? Can you please try some other question , it will work , or even for heavy question it work , You can check its working from interface too Please check once !! We will be sending out emails to both sets. Ones who have to keep it on and ones who can shut it down. If you have not received a shutdown notice, assume that you have to keep it on. I apologise for the late reply, we ran into some unforeseen problems, hence the delay. Thank you for your patience, Kind regards @carlton, @Jivraj, @Saransh_Saini Respected Sir, I received an email stating we have to turn on URL endpoint again. I am using free version of NGROK if I want to re-start my application then my NGROK URL will change and the forms are closed. What Should I do ? this is urgent. @Saransh_Saini @carlton sir today I received this email image1408×305 10.9 KB I have did not turned it off it is just that the first request take time of 50 to 60 sec as you can see in the image. image1842×974 33.9 KB and it also take same time in linux image965×175 6.84 KB Please allow some time for my server hosted on Render to initialize, as it may take a moment to become fully active. Thank you for your patience and understanding. Just reply to the email that I have sent to you regarding your query. We will make exceptions for students facing this issue of having a changed end point due to the way ngrok works. Kind regards Humble Request to Update API Request Link Dear Team, I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to kindly ask if it would be possible to update my API request link for project 2 in TDS. I realized that I mistakenly used the wrong endpoint in my earlier request. Previous API Request Link: project2llm-production.up.railway.app IITM Assignment API - Swagger UI Correct API Request Link: https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/ https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/ Would it be possible for you to allow me to make this change, or kindly update the link on my behalf? I sincerely apologize for the confusion, and I’d be truly grateful for your support and understanding. Thank you so much for your time and consideration. Warm regards, Pratyush Pulak Nishhank Thank you for considering it also one question sir, how long do I have to keep it running ? But Sir please give some bonus , As in earlier terms , everyone got S grade in TDS , without doing anything , and from this term the difficulty level increased rapidly , just like e^x Although I know that our LLM doesnt worked fully(100%) , but atleast they worked 50-60% We have learned so many things and try to implement in it too,… Atleast give some bonus for our hardwork , and participating in both LLM project , so even we dont get S grade , but will get B , A , grade … and our CGPA doesn’t decrease much because projects hold the major chunk in grading @carlton Agree with this sentiment. Hope there are bonus points for participation in discourse as well. @carlton i submitted incorrect api request link my correct api link: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/post_ask_question is it possible to change some how… suppose i have resolved the hosting issue that the link i provided had now , will u still evaluate as i fixed the issue in response to the email i received on 8th april? Sir, @Jivraj can I know how long do I need to keep the server running ? Roll No. 22f200559 It seems you have provided a local address endpoint, which means it will only work on your computer. If I run it on my computer, it will redirect to my port 8000 if it is running. till your endpoint has evaluated @carlton,@Saransh_Saini sir my roll number is 23f2004462 Due to an unexpected power outage, my PC shut down abruptly, causing my local server and ngrok tunnel to terminate. When the system rebooted, I restarted the server and ngrok, which generated a new API endpoint as ngrok URLs are temporary and change with every session. The previous endpoint is no longer accessible, and the new one now serves as the API endpoint. I understand the need for a consistent URL and will explore solutions like reserving a domain through ngrok’s paid plan to prevent such issues in the future. Apologies for any inconvenience caused, and thank you for understanding.

Or is it like the submission had ran but ultimately produced my score 0. If this is the case I request you to reevaluate my submission. @Jivraj @carlton Respected Course Team, Harsh this side from NIT Allahabad, I am writing to inform you that I received a notification image2096×1154 160 KB regarding an issue with my submission. I believe the issue may have occurred because I had mistakenly provided an incorrect API endpoint in my earlier submission. However, my server is still actively running on Vercel https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app and the correct API endpoint is: correct api : https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/ Everything else in the project is functioning as expected. I kindly request you to re-evaluate my submission using the correct endpoint as i am currently in my 3rd year of BTech Chemical engineering at NIT Allahabad and my placement session is coming so i don’t want to get failed in this course due to such a small mistake.

PS: Maybe send a mail to everyone to update the access of their GA7 links to viewer for everyone at IIT Madras. Just submit whatever is the latest working link. You do not have to submit a new form if you have received an email that said your evaluation was completed. We already sent an email asking people to update their ga7 permissions @Saransh_Saini Could you let me know if my evaluation is complete? @carlton , @Jivraj @s.anand @jkmadathil Dear Sirs, Most of us have hosted our projects in Azure and this is costing us real money .. We have just gotten to a stage where if you could just please let us know if our endpoints have been evaluated and there is some score we will happily take it down. Kindly bear in mind the there is a financial component ( some of us have free accounts ) involved here and I urge and request you to kindly expedite the evaluation process so that we decrease the financial burden placed upon us by this exercise… @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Sir, please confirm me whether I have been evaluated or not. Because my azure balance is reducing day by day. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini I just got the mail stating that my evaluation is complete and I can turn off my server. However the Cloud Run logs show that all POST requests were made to the wrong end point. The exact url I gave ends with “/api/” but every POST request was either made to “/api” which resulted in a 307 response or with “http” instead of “https” which resulted in a 302 response. Only the get requests were made to the correct endpoint but since the app was supposed to allow POST requests only, making GET requests just resulted in 405. 10001508681080×2340 242 KB I request you to use the exact url I gave in the gform and make POST requests to it to re-evaluate me.

I want to understand whether this is just a wrong email I received or if there is an issue with your system’s evaluation.

I had got email saying please update endpoint because earlier endpoint was having problems. I had sent https://c7f6-150-107-43-5.ngrok-free.app/api/ as updated endpoint in google form on April 10th. Same day I had got around 9 requests on that endpoint around 4:56 PM. They were 200 OK requests on /api/ and 4 requests were 307 redirect on /api. I presume they were from TDS team. Next day got email to shut off endpoint. I had tested endpoint locally and on ngrok. Both were fine. Was the updated endpoint in the google form evaluated? Was there some problem with the updated endpoint? @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj Please look into this, my portal is showing zero marks @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini My portal is showing 0 even no github repo is made so are evalaution even done??? Pls tell @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini On my portal it’s showing that Course Project Score 2 - Absent but I submitted and fill the form also deployed the app successfully. Namaste Sir. The projects have been quite challenging, and I have applied my knowledge to the best of my ability. I’ve submitted the project but it’s showing 0 in the portal. Bonus marks for creating APIs and so in the projects would be greatly appreciated. I am planning to start my degree in the upcoming term, and this is the last subject I am completing at this level. So, I kindly request your assistance, sir. Hello Sir, For me as well Project 2 scores are showing 0.I have spent alot of time and effort in this project. Please look into it. @carlton @Saransh_Saini sir , I am writing to kindly request a re-evaluation of my Project 2 submission. As I had previously mentioned, the Render deployment link I submitted may take approximately 50 to 60 seconds to activate upon the first load. This behavior is typical of free-tier deployments on Render, and I assure you that the application functions correctly in both Podman and Linux environments. Upon reviewing my Render logs, I could not find any indication that the project was accessed or evaluated during the expected activation time. To ensure smooth accessibility, I have also deployed the same GitHub repository on Railway and submitted that link as well. If possible, I kindly request either of the following: Re-evaluation using the Railway link I provided, or Re-evaluation using the Render link, with allowance for the 50–60 second activation time. Your consideration and understanding in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if any further clarification or information is needed. Thank you for your support and guidance. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini I knew that this affected my project 2 score and that’s why I made that post(the one to which I’m replying in this message). Please look into this. My api is working and still on and will be on till 18th April when my credits will run out. Please re-evaluate my project 2 with the exact url I gave in the form. My project 2 was evaluated on the wrong url and this led to a zero in the project 2 score. Hi sir @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj @s.anand I need your immediate attention regarding my project-2, as I received zero marks, but my server is running completely fine. Below are the key points that I need you to look into: Server is running and reachable. and Giving Correct Answers GET and POST requests tested via Postman and VS Code, both return 200 OK. Tested on my laptop and by 10+ other people – all received correct results. No issues seen in logs or deployment – everything was set up properly.

My api is still running sir my score is showing zero even if i have submitted the project correctly.please re-evaluate my project https://roe-i6ghzat4g-manu-cs-projects.vercel.app/ @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj I got a mail saying project 2 endpoints will be tested again. It also says that those updated endpoints which were submitted in the google form will be tested. Since i had submitted ngrok endpoint, wont it be invalid now? And if i start ngrok server wont it give me new endpoint? Although I have completed all the required tasks for Project 2, it is still showing me as absent. I kindly request you to look into this issue, sir. @Jivraj @carlton . @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini hello sir, what will happen if new score is lesser than the old one? will you consider whichever score is greater or new one sir? Kindly reply sir. and considering the best score in these 2 evaluations is better i think sir. Kindly consider this sir. Thank you Harish Could someone clarify whether the endpoint should include /api when being evaluated? I submitted it without /api and I’m wondering if it will be automatically appended or if we must include it explicitly. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini there is no automatic appending. We will test exactly what we sent in the email (if you got an email) which is exactly what you submitted . we will consider the greater of the two need to include the /api in the end. without that your mark will be 0 , since it cannot be evaluated without an end point You were not present in the form Anand gave us. It most likely because you submitted after the deadline (or made edits after the deadline, if the form he shared allowed edits). sir i am using ngrok. Shall i edit the old url in the form with the new one ? will you consider the new url in the form? If u restart ngrok it changes endpoint every time. Your old endpoint is non existent as far as i know. yeah thats why asking. Is the marks shown on dashboard out of 20 or 100? coz i can clearly see in the logs that my api has answered all questions correctly, and my dashboard shows score of 20 for project 2. I also want to know the same thing. Our old ngrok endpoint is useless at this point. marks are always out of 100 on dashboard @carlton sir i am using ngrok. Shall i edit the old url in the form with the new one ? will you consider the new url in the form? I’m writing to clarify the status of my Project 2, which is currently marked as “Absent”. I would like to respectfully state that I submitted the form before the deadline — specifically on 31st March 2025 at 22:11 , and I have the response copy as proof. I would also like to emphasize that: No edits were made to the form after submission. I did not make any changes to the project or submission after the deadline. My Vercel API is still active and functioning as expected. Here are the submitted links: GitHub Repo: GitHub - itskaiffazal/tdsproject2: Tools in data science Project 2 - TDS Solver API Endpoint: https://tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/ I kindly request you to review my submission and take the necessary steps to update the status. image1897×546 29.5 KB image1533×736 42.8 KB image1905×953 32.7 KB You used your personal email address while filling the form.

I sincerely apologize for not using my official email address — it was an honest oversight and not an attempt to bypass any rules. I’d be truly grateful if you could kindly consider evaluating my project based on the valid, timely submission and the active working links provided. This situation is quite distressing for me, as it could result in a significant setback, potentially requiring me to repeat the entire course. I fully acknowledge that the mistake was mine — a small yet critical one — and I sincerely request that if there is even a slight possibility of evaluation, please consider it. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to assist with verification. Your understanding and support would genuinely mean a lot. Thank you for your time and consideration. Respected Carlton Sir, I thought in gform we need to submit the deployment url: tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app TDS Solver but for the API testing we need to add /api/ to the url: https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/api/ Please do my evaluation on this link, its the same just we need to go to /api/ in the URL Sir i also did the same mistake and am truly sorry for what i did but it is my dearest request if you can look into this matter as it is very essential that the project is evaluated. I am once again very sorry for the mistake @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Dear Sirs, I apologize for the inconvenience caused by reaching out again. I came to know that many students have received an email stating that the re-evaluation for Project 2 will be conducted today between 11 PM and 2 AM. However, I have not received any such communication on my end. I would like to bring to your attention that I actively helped several peers deploy their servers on Vercel and resolve various issues, and many of them received marks as high as 80. Unfortunately, my own record still shows as “Absent,” despite the fact that I submitted the Google Form well before the deadline and my server has been live and running for over two weeks. For your verification, I am attaching screenshots of my GitHub repository and the Vercel deployment dashboard, which clearly show the deployment. I sincerely request you to kindly consider this issue. This situation has caused significant mental stress, especially as I had already faced a grading issue in Project 1. The anxiety and uncertainty around my Project 2 score have negatively affected my focus during the end-term exam and viva for other projects as well. Receiving a zero in this project would only further impact my overall performance and morale, despite the genuine effort I have put in. I genuinely hope for a positive response and a fair re-evaluation. Thank you very much for your time and understanding. api link : https://tds-proj2f.vercel.app/ git949×580 62.4 KB Respected Sir, I thought we need to submit the deployment url in gform tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app TDS Solver but for the API testing we need to add /api/ to the url: https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/api/ Please do my evaluation on this link, its the same just we need to go to /api/ in the URL thank you @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj @carlton Respected Sir, Sir I made a mistake while submitting the GFORM in hurry, I submitted the deployment URL instead of API URL: currently for re-evaluation my URL that I received on my mail id is: https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/ but for API testing we need to add /api/ to the URL so final URL is: https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/api/ I’m sorry for this mistake sir, please accept this small change, we just need to add /api/ to the URL Thank you actually 2 of my friend had submitted similar url with no /api/ but he got 80 marks and I also submitted without /api/ url but I got 0 so for re evaluation sir please add /api/ to the original URL as mentioned Above Please Sir Thank you 23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in @carlton I appreciate your response. I didn’t include “/api” at the end. Could you confirm if I’m allowed to update the form now before tonight’s evaluation? Thanks in advance. I would like to clarify that I had submitted the form before the deadline. However, I believe I might have submitted it once again after the deadline, just to ensure that my project was submitted correctly. Please find attached the screenshot of my submission made before the deadline. Also, I haven’t received any response sheet for the form submitted after the deadline. Thank you! @carlton @Jivraj IMG_20250416_1908131080×2182 234 KB hello sir, the link have submitted has a UI interface for solving the question which looks somewhat like this image1126×936 61.3 KB in order to access the endpoint we just need to add “/api” on the end however in the form I have submitted the link without the end line. Please Consider, Thanks & Regards, So anyone with an ngrok endpoint can send their new ngrok to us, but obviously you will need to start the server up much sooner than 11 in that case. An email will be sent to you specifically. DO NOT give us the endpoint on discourse. Reply to the email we will send specifically for you. Hello, For my results, it is marked as absent. Can you please confirm what has gone wrong as I am really confident I have submitted Gform on deadline day around 3-5pm. Thank you @carlton I’m not able to restart my Virtual Machine as my Azure subscription has expired and my account is disabled. image1039×650 50.9 KB Please suggest the way forward. Since we will be evaluating between 11 to am you can run application on local machine and provide us with the ngrok url by 10:30 pm. Send us the correct endpoint test it before sending us. @Jivraj I should send ngrok endpoint replying to the same email u sent me right? No extra google form will be there right? Yes to the same Mail @Jivraj Dear Sir, I’m sorry to bother you again, but I’m in a desperate situation and have no other option but to reach out through this channel. As I mentioned in my previous message, my score has been marked as “absent,” even though I submitted my project well before the deadline. Additionally, I have not received any communication regarding a re-evaluation. I kindly request you to look into this matter and provide a response at the earliest. *Request to Use Public DNS for Course Tool API Deployment or Use Alternate Endpoint Dear @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @carlton I hope you’re doing well! I’m currently running my server and trying to access the API hosted at: https://sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app/api/ However, I’m encountering the following error: curl: (6) Could not resolve host: sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app After some investigation, I found that the issue is related to DNS resolution. The API becomes accessible when using public DNS services like Google (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1). This suggests that the current deployment environment may be using a restricted or unreliable DNS resolver, which causes access issues on some networks (e.g., Jio). Suggested Fix: To ensure reliable access for all students, could you please consider updating the deployment or testing environment to use a public DNS provider? Recommended options: Google DNS: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4 Cloudflare DNS: 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1 This can typically be configured via Docker settings or the environment’s networking configuration. Alternate Option: If the DNS change isn’t possible at the moment, I kindly request that you evaluate my project using the previously deployed endpoint instead: https://tds-project-2-pnlm.onrender.com/api/ Please note that this endpoint may take 50 to 60 seconds to respond, as it’s hosted on a platform with a cold start delay — but it is fully functional and provides the correct outputs. Both endpoints are currently active and return identical results. Thank you so much for your time and support — I truly appreciate the effort you’re putting into helping us succeed in this course! Best regards, Sahil Raj Will it be possible for the evaluation of vercel link as well i have veen marked absent due to the email issues prevailing please look into this matter Sir, my endpoint is deployed on render too. Hence it may take upto two minutes for the server to respond. Thankyou! Thanks. These re evals are running on the gcloud vm so it should not be an issue, but we will check anyway. Its a good tip. what should i do , i deleted my vm after the email that your evaluation completed , it is said in email that evaluation log and score will be sent but nothing come , it seems my updated api endpoint is not evaluated , score comes from previous endpoint , please what to do now ? again i am saying i deleted my vm @s.anand @carlton Dear @Jivraj @carlton In the google form which we submitted I had pasted the API endpoint as the one which I got in the vercel dashboard i.e. https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/ whereas the correct api for giving post requests has /api added to the above which i forgot to add. i.e**.https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/api/** I have checked again and the post requests are working. I know that I made a mistake in the form and regret the same. If possible, please evaluate my project 2 with the above endpoint @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini These are my new endpoints: https://gasolver-hgayefe7b0avhpc6.southindia-01.azurewebsites.net/api/ I have replied to the email regarding the re-evaluation message that was sent to me. Since I deleted the Azure Web Service Plan after receiving instructions from the TDS team to stop the service, I now need to host it again .Please let me know the next steps. Greetings, @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to kindly request the addition of an API to the link I previously submitted for Project 2. I realized that including this API is essential for the complete functionality and demonstration of the project. please use this api url -: https://rahulbot-a369.onrender.com/api/ instead of this - https://rahulbot-a369.onrender.com/ Thank you for your time and support. Looking forward to your response. Best regards, Rahul Pathak 23f2000798@ds.study.iitm.ac.in @Pritul_raut , @22f3001416 Start server locally and send us your ngrok url’s. @rahul_pathak12 @JerinJohn01 Please fill the form below we will only pick your endpoints from there, we won’t be picking from discourse posts. accounts.google.com Google Forms: Sign-in Access Google Forms with a personal Google account or Google Workspace account (for business use). Hi @all Please use the form that is sent. We will consider it if you send it as soon as possible. Please note that this is still at our discretion. We will try to consider everyones endpoint who submit on this form only. https://forms.gle/m2pzirzGvphPB5zq8 Hi Jivraj, I would like to draw attention to a specific question regarding the process of creating an HTML file and publishing it to GitHub. I notice that I am not providing a preloaded answer when this question arises. Instead, it creates a new repository and an HTML file, then deploys it on GitHub. Initially, it presents a URL, but I understand that your server checks to verify whether the URL contains valid HTML. This verification process takes time, which can lead to an incorrect response when checking the URL right after deployment. At that moment, the URL might not display the HTML content or be verified by your server, even though eventually, the deployment is successful and the URL is correct. Please keep in mind that publishing to GitHub requires some time; it’s not feasible to expedite this process drastically, to my knowledge. I checked and noted that this question has been asked recently. Additionally, I believe the image may show your server’s IP address. Thank you! 10000638561920×858 139 KB How long you want us to keep timeout of request is, right now we have 60 seconds of timeout. @carlton @Jivraj I have received 5 “200 OK” POST requests on my ngrok endpoint(which i had sent replying to @Jivraj email before 10:30 PM) between 11:02 PM to 11:05 PM. Do i need to update my previous gform? Or is everything done from my end? Im keeping server on till tomorrow morning. @carlton yes sir same doubt as @GaURaVinDeX . i also got 5 200 ok requests in my terinal. i sent the url to the mail i got before. do i need to update this gform again? or Or is everything done from my end? I m keeping server on till tomorrow morning. If you filled the gform that is sufficient. sir i replied for the mail i recieved for new ngrok link. so now you are asking to fill this gform sir? If you filled the gform before its fine. Its for all those that had accidently gave us wrong ones. Sir, I replied to the email received by me from @jivraj as it was instructed. Should i fill gform now also? Email to jivraj for ngrok was fine. Since he emailed you directly for the ngrok folks Ok. Because our gform of 10th April has old ngrok endpoint which isnt valid now. Only the one which we have emailed to @Jivraj before 10:30 PM is current active. So i conclude our emailed ngrok endpoints of today to @Jivraj are enough. Yes todays ngrok you sent to jivraj is fine. Because old ones are invalid @carlton Please recheck my project 2 also as I got 0 on dashboard. I and my two friends made this together but he got 80 and I got 0, how is this possible? Sir, submitted the gform and also replied to the mail that I received about re-evaluation sir , I got 39 with project 2 score as 0. Will fail by 1 mark if my project 2 is 0. haha… You did not provide the right endpoint. Did you fill the form with the right endpoint. deploying time the html page on GitHub page that is not in my hand algsoch.github.io Professional Portfolio | 24f2006438 you can clearly see there is html page publish i think that time my api gave answer with this url Do you have proof that you have submitted before deadline? Because the gfrom shows the timestamp of being after deadline Sir, I had submitted the project on 31st March at 11:30 PM itself. However, I made a change to the Vercel endpoint and updated it on 1st April. I can provide a screenshot of the Vercel deployment as proof. Unfortunately, I didn’t keep a copy of the Google Form submission. But to be honest, I shared the deployed project with some of my friends on 1st and 2nd April, after my edit, and they submitted it through the form after me. They received marks, but I haven’t received the same. Hi @afsalshah You submitted google form with wrong email address. This was the email address you used for filling form. quizapp.mad2@gmail.com Sorry, Sir. I just realized the reason why my submission was not considered — I had used the email ID I created specifically for my MAD2 project. It was a genuine mistake on my part. However, I noticed in a previous thread that another student who submitted using a different email ID was given a chance to update it. I kindly request you to consider giving me the same opportunity as well. I have given my endpoint to the gform circulated in this thread. We didn’t account for such cases. The purpose of that form was to reevaluate only those who submitted using their IITM email but had provided the wrong endpoint. Anyone who didn’t use their IITM email during submission—even if they later filled out the form—was filtered out and not considered for reevaluation. I understand your point, Sir. It was a mistake on my part, but if possible, I kindly request you to consider my submission given the circumstances. can you send this email which is there in screenshot to me(22f3002542@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) ? If that proof you can give we will consider reevaluating. Hi @carlton @Saransh_Saini I believe it is a bit late now, but my Programming Quiz score is being displayed as Absent, I remember very well that I got a 4 out of 10, but it has been displaying Absent for a very long time now. This the ROE exam I am talking about here. Kindly fix this issue too. Hi Team, Yesterday, I received a mail stating that our Project 2 would be reevaluated between 11 PM and 2 AM tonight, and that the following endpoint would be used to test the API: https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/ However, I have not seen any logs in Railway during that timeframe, and my score on the dashboard is still showing as 0. Could you please confirm if my URL was actually reevaluated? Thank you! @carlton @Jivraj @s.anand @Saransh_Saini Dear Sir Yesterday I received the mail to start my server from 11 pm to 2 am, but I am very sorry that I did not read the mail on time and hence could not start the server on time. I request you kindly to give a second chance for re evaluation. I have done the project and it would not be fair if it is not evaluated. Thank you Hi Team, Please confirm if the evaluations were carried out last night as I don’t see any logs on my api. I had shared my updated ngrok link on email as well as the form shared yesterday. Thank You! yes i have filled that but i have tested my API many times before and after gform I am really sorry sir for bothering you again and again but i kindly request you to look into this matter i had submitted my gform link but i am marked absent the link for my git repository is GitHub - kartikayy1/project2final And my vercel link is project2final-beta.vercel.app TDS Solver It is my humble request if you can evaluate the project and update my marks I am really sorry sir for bothering you again and again but i kindly request you to look into this matter i had submitted my gform link but i am marked absent the link for my git repository is GitHub - kartikayy1/project2final And my vercel link is project2final-beta.vercel.app TDS Solver sir i didn’t get any mail regarding evaluation of project 2 yet , though i submitted it before the deadline Sir, have the scores been updated after the re-evaluation? Will we receive logs for the evaluation? You filled form after 11 pm, and we pulled out all the responses before 11 Pm. yes logs will be sentout And sir have the results been updated on Dashboard? Asking because the score’s still 0 on the dashboard. Subject: Clarification Regarding Project 2 Reevaluation Hi Team, I received an email yesterday stating that our Project 2 would be reevaluated between 11 PM and 2 AM tonight. However, I haven’t seen any deployment logs on Railway during that timeframe, and my score on the dashboard is still showing as 0. My url is working perfectly still there is no logs in the railway. Could you please confirm whether my Project 2 was actually reevaluated? Thank you! @Jivraj @carlton Can you send us proof that you have submitted the form, I looked at the submissions and could not find your email there. Your submission was reevaluated, I confirm that in timeframe of 11PM to 2 AM No They will be updated by today. I had replied to the email before 11pm with the updated URL as suggested by you in the earlier thread before the form was released. I submitted the form as soon as I saw the message on discourse which was after 11pm. You used this email address for submitting form kingshubh011@gmail.com Which is not IITM email address, how would we know whom it belongs to? can you show us what you submitted? Was it a valid url ? Oh no , i didn’t noticed because the deadline was about to end. But nothing can be done now? My project is working fine and the score i got in project 1 are also not good so I need the marks to improve my score Sir! Is it possible that the railway won’t show any of the logs even if the api url is tested? I don’t know answer to that question, have never used railway, you need to figure out yourself Sir here is a screenshot of my google form that i submitted 10001888201080×2400 196 KB I am really sorry sir i cant apologise enough but by mistake i used my personal email address instead of the iitm emial snd i deeply apologize for the inconveniences but i request you to kindly consider this project as it is very essential for me to pass this course I will make sure that such silly mistake does not happen in the future but i request you to please Consider this time. The email used would be kartikaytaunk@gmail.com @Jivraj Since html page take time to host and github link comes in output early … how will u guys will evaluate that question since after since website take extra 5-8 second to get live but the github url in output comes before that Screenshot_2025-04-17-13-16-34-275_com.google.android.gm1080×2340 230 KB Yes, the new page took about 5–10 seconds to go live after the GitHub repository was created when we used Gmail as a parameter. If the Gmail is fixed, we can hardcode it in advance. In our case, Gmail is a parameter, so the function should remain dynamic and it would take 5-10 second to go live after we received answer. We are not evaluating any wrong submissions. sir my project 2 is also showing 0 but it was working. pls check if it was not working at least give some marks for the effort that w have put. I also accept that we have learnt a lot in this course and marks doesnot matter. but after putting a lot of effort day and night getting a zero, gives a drastic discouragement to even look at the laptop. pls consider if possible. I have completed and submitted the assigned project 2, and I have verified that it is working correctly as per the given instructions. However, I noticed that the score awarded to me for the project is 0. I believe this may be an error, as my project meets the required criteria and functions as expected. I kindly request you to review my submission and let me know if there was any issue during evaluation or submission that may have led to this result. I have deployed the project on vercel as instructed. I have uploaded all the links in google form and submitted it. To support this, I am attaching a screenshot of the PowerShell window that shows an example of my application running successfully for one of the questions. ss1525×535 24.1 KB @carlton @Jivraj I appreciate the team incorporating my updated response at the endpoint with the “/api” path and re-evaluating accordingly, as well as sharing the results via email. To my surprise, when I invoke the same endpoint that was evaluated — using the correct multipart/form-data payload with both question and file fields — I consistently receive a 200 OK response with the expected output. Moreover, if I omit either field from the form-data, the server returns the exact validation error mentioned in the re-evaluation report, which makes sense. Based on this behavior and the details in the shared report, I’d like to confirm: during the re-evaluation, was the request payload indeed sent with both question and file fields included in the form-data? For reference, I’ve attached a screenshot demonstrating the response. re-evaluvation-report1636×1680 311 KB Screenshot at Apr 17 18-34-301938×934 130 KB Screenshot at Apr 17 18-35-461948×940 136 KB Success1922×940 132 KB WhatsApp Image 2025-04-17 at 19.08.011600×385 66.9 KB I would like to highlight an issue regarding the evaluation of the TDS Solver Project 2. As per the official project instructions, our API was clearly required to handle POST requests at /api/ with multipart/form-data. Nowhere in the documentation was it mentioned that the API should handle GET requests. However, during evaluation, GET requests seem to be made to the endpoint, leading to 405 Method Not Allowed errors. These errors are expected behavior for an API that is properly built to accept only POST, exactly as per the project guidelines. Therefore, I request that the evaluation team only test using POST requests as originally instructed. Penalizing students because of unnecessary GET requests would be unfair and incorrect based on the project requirements. Please ensure that evaluation happens strictly according to the provided instructions. For further more clarification to prove my endpoint is working as expected. image1942×904 203 KB image1936×910 128 KB image1940×928 137 KB If there are any additional scenarios you’d like me to test, feel free to let me know, I’d be happy to help validate that the endpoint is functioning as expected. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini image1430×142 5.42 KB the answer is correct expect for extra spaces it was told that those spaces are neglectable still it showed as error plz consider this @carlton @Jivraj @carlton this was one of the question it asked on api ‘’‘{ “api”: “https://app.algsoch.tech/api/”, “test_code”: “GA2_q3”, “status”: “FAILED”, “actual”: “ tag not found”, “expected”: “24f2006438@ds.study.iitm.ac.in” },’‘’ Now I am demonstrating that my HTML page includes an email tag. You can see it here. image640×238 10.6 KB and { “api”: “https://app.algsoch.tech/api/”, “test_code”: “GA4_q6”, “status”: “FAILED”, “actual”: “GitHub - sminez/ad: an adaptable text editor”, “expected”: “The 2FA app that tells you when you get `314159`” } I am unsure of the exact question, but it seems that the question can be modified with search terms and points. For example, in the account, it was stated as [‘text editor’, at least 77 points’]. If this were the parameter, then my answer would be correct, and I have proof. image855×383 19.5 KB and this { “api”: “https://app.algsoch.tech/api/”, “test_code”: “GA3_q2”, “status”: “FAILED”, “actual”: 125, “expected”: “Range: 55 to 65” } I’m not sure what the exact question was, but it was correct for me again. I have another question or doubt. Case 3: JSON Key Count – XF Parameter (GA5_q7) { “api”: “https://app.algsoch.tech/api/”, “test_code”: “GA5_q7”, “status”: “ERROR”, “error”: “invalid literal for int() with base 10: ‘Error: Invalid JSON in the file. Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)’” } What Was Expected: The question required developing a script that: Parses a large, deeply nested JSON log file, and Counts how many times a specific key — represented by XF — appears in the JSON structure. It was explicitly stated that: Only key matches for XF are to be counted, not values. The file to be used was: E:\\data science tool\\GA5\\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json What I Did: I used the correct approach, parsing the nested JSON file and counting how many times the key XF appeared throughout the structure. Here’s the actual response I got using this cURL command: curl -X POST https://app.algsoch.tech/api/ \\ -H “accept: application/json” \\ -F “question=…How many times does XF appear as a key?” \\ -F “file=@E:\\data science tool\\GA5\\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json” API Output:{“answer”:“14602”} This indicates that my logic worked correctly and the key XF appeared 14,602 times, exactly as intended. What Went Wrong on API Side: The API returned a parsing error, indicating: “invalid literal for int() with base 10: ‘Error: Invalid JSON in the file…’” However: My file was valid JSON, properly parsed. The actual issue seems to be on the API’s side — possibly mishandling the file read or decoding before passing it to the evaluator. It may have expected an integer but received a string-wrapped error or non-integer data, causing it to crash. Insight: If the original question was about counting the key XF, my solution was 100% correct. However, if the question dynamically changed the key name or added extra criteria (e.g., only count if value == true, or only under a certain section), then the result might differ. But from the default XF-focused question, my logic and result match perfectly. image1491×166 5.46 KB in this question even though the answer is correct except those extra spaces it has been showing error plz check into this @carlton @Jivraj Issue with Marks Not Updated on Dashboard Dear Team, I would like to bring to your attention that although I have successfully passed at least one out of the five questions, the marks have not yet been updated in my dashboard. Kindly look into this issue and update my Project 2 marks accordingly. Thank you for your assistance! @Jivraj @carlton @23f2002286 and everyone else, At the end of the term operations has a lot of updates to push. We have sent the marks to them, but they have not yet pushed it to the dashboard. As soon as they push it, they will inform us and we will then send out a discrepancy form to all of you if you find any issues. Thanks and Kind regards I had completed project 2 but because of a mistake i filled the form with my personal mail id fue to which the project eas not evaluated i fully consider this to be my fault and assure that something like this will not happen in the future . If my evaluation of project 2 is not done then i will fail the tds course and will have to repeat this course which will cause a financial strain on me I know that it is difficult for you to consider this request but it is my humblest request if you can just look through the project i tried to complete the project with the best of my abilities It will be really helpful if you can access the project My git repository link is - GitHub - kartikayy1/project2final My vercel link is - https://project2final-beta.vercel.app/ initially I have received a score of 80 for project 2 but today im seeing on my dashboard it is showing 0. I request you to please check the discrepancy. @Jivraj @carlton my roll no is 23f1002558 My project 2 score is showing absent, roll num is 23f1000561. Good Afternoon Sir. This is regarding project 1 and project 2. Project-1 Evaluation Sir, For the project 1, I have written the code, uploaded in GitHub and the dockerfile image is created and uploaded successfully. Sir, I already contacted regarding Project - 1, you said to check it by replicating the test environment. I did till running the dockerfile but I needed evaluate.py sir, which I didn’t get it. I got only 5 marks sir. Can you please check my code once sir and verify it as I have written the code and the dockerfile is running successfully. Project-2 Evaluation Regarding project 2 also, I have uploaded my code in GitHub and deployed my app in Vercel. But, I got 0 sir. Can you check my code once again and verify it? According to the guidance given, I deployed my app through Vercel. The app got deployed but I am getting 404 Error, even after trying any troubleshooting method. Maybe, Vercel is in development stage. Sir, but I wrote the code and deployed, but I got 0 marks only. Please check it and guide me to get it corrected. Sir, due to the projects I got poor marks on TDS. Please, I request you to re-evaluate and give me correct marks. In anticipation of quick response Thank You Hi everyone, I know that some of you might be feeling anxious about your scores etc. We are currently in the process of validating your scores on all the projects, roe, assignments, exam and bonus, so we will not be able to respond quickly to each individual post here for the time being. Once we validate, you will receive an email with your official scores that we will be pushing to Operations in a single update. Along with that email you will receive a discrepancy form where you can raise your issues. This will give us a consolidated view of problems and fix them. Kindly wait for the email to come to you. It will be sent sometime this afternoon. Kind regards, TDS Team image1366×768 127 KB Dear Team, this is proof that I have successfully submitted the form and the api is still working, why am i still marked as absent?

Our endpoints are open to internet and there are bots everywhere which will send these kind of random requests to scan for potential exploit/hacking targets. Good Evening, I shreyansh Singh have been marked absent even though I submitted, 23f2002745 Maybe. Still clarification from @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini will be highly appreciated. I too was getting these requests. @carlton sir mentioned this in one of the posts: Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread Tools in Data Science They are malicious probes. A global cyber war is going on. So anything that can be compromised is being probed. Just recieved this on my mail. Happy that everything worked out pretty well w/o the need for hardcoding.

A friend of mine submitted a similar URL and received full marks. Furthermore, I have updated my URL using HTTPS via Google Forms, so I kindly request you to consider evaluating my project using the latest URL provided. This is a humble request, as I am currently at risk of receiving a grade ‘E’, which will significantly impact my overall CGPA. As an alternative, I am also willing to retake the course in the next term and pay the fee again if needed. In the P1, unfortunately scored zero due to a minor mistake and was not given an opportunity to correct it. I truly believe that in real-life scenarios, we are often given chances to rectify such errors, and I sincerely hope for the same consideration here. @s.anand Subject: Request to Share My Student-Built TDS Assistant Platform Dear Sir/Madam, I hope you’re doing well. I’m Vicky Kumar, a student from the Data Science and Applications program at IIT Madras. Over the last few months, I’ve built a personal project called “Vicky App” — a smart assistant platform specifically designed to help students in courses like TDS,. The system is capable of: Accurately solving over 90% of assignment-style questions using regex and phonetic matching Dynamically executing the right code logic based on the student’s input Processing uploaded files such as Excel, PDF, CSV, and JSON Delivering instant answers, completely independent of ChatGPT or any external LLM You can test the platform here: https://app.algsoch.tech What’s in it for students: They type their question, and the backend executes the correct solution automatically Especially helpful for GA preparation, understanding problem logic, and reducing repetitive workload I’ve made it free for the first 3 questions After that, students can access the full platform for just ₹199/month, which helps me cover system maintenance and hosting costs My Humble Request: This is a tool I’ve built with immense effort and love for this course, and I genuinely believe it can benefit many students. To sustain the platform — hosting, APIs, file management, and backend orchestration — I’ve introduced a small paid model after a free trial. I would be extremely grateful if you could test it once and, if you find it helpful, consider sharing it with upcoming students or mentioning it in a Moodle announcement. It’s built by an IIT Madras student, for IIT Madras students — with the sole goal of making their learning smoother, faster, and smarter. Thank you so much for your time and support. Warm regards, Vicky Kumar B.S. Data Science and Applications, IIT Madras npdimagine@gmail.com | +91 8383848219 Portfolio | LinkedIn It’s a tool built by a fellow IITM student, with deep respect for the academic rigor of this program — not to replace learning, but to accelerate it.

          "content": "@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Dear Sir, I have few questions. It is written in the Tools in Data Science that we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I don’t think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below. In GA 1 ques 13 and GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI gh which we have to install in the vercel instance using apt package manager. But, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages. In GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that? Also after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first install ngrok package. In GA 2 ques 8, uploading an image to Dockerhub requires docker package installed. In GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance? Many ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled. Can Vercel allow/do that? And many more Most tasks mentioned above like installing packages etc. requires sudo privilages or may face restrictions set by Vercel. Vercel does not provide sudo access or any form of root access to its hosting environment which is required to perform the above tasks. Many of these task can be done in our local systems (exposing to internet using cloudflare tunnels/ngrok), but we cannot run our systems 24*7 during evaluation. I can see only one option left that is renting a VPS from server providers like digitalocean, gcp, aws etc, which will provide us sudo access and 100% uptime. Also, some ques requires external toolings like In GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365. In GA1 ques 6, we have to use Devtools to show/find the hidden element in the question. Now, the question parameter in the POST request will be plain text, so how the element can hide there? GA 2 ques 4 and GA 2 ques 5 uses Google Colab specific python libraries like google.colab which can’t be installed locally. How to solve these above questions that require explicit usage of external tools. Also, handling POST request for some questions are not clear like In GA 2 ques 2, we have to compress the image and upload the image as answer. So, now how to response such answer in json object. Should we encode the resultant compressed image as base64 string or Image URL or Data URI. Some ques have images in them. For those images in GAs, I right clicked and used “Save as” to save the images and then done the required computations. So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment? Another concern is regarding the OpenAI API TOKEN, unlike Project 1, Project 2 does not have an API_TOKEN parameter in the POST request. Hence, the API TOKEN provided from https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev will be also used during evaluation. Now, what will happen if our API TOKEN credits gets end during evaluation. The LLM will throw errors then. Please advise what we should do. please clarify Sir.",

It would be helpful for the project (when running the Curl command for each of the question) if the assignments can display the answers we’ve entered as well for verification purposes. The first question of GA1 q1 needs for us to run vs code but when executing it through vercel its not possible because vercel is a serverless environment. In this case, is it okay to manually enter the answer in the code, so when the question is triggered it takes the manual output from the code. Can you provide some clarity as to how the question is supposed to be and structured ? Or should the code be able to handle multiple variants of the question? To address this concern, i tried to implement sentence_transformers using a lightweight model but the vercel application build failed saying that the data is too long and that Vercel serverless function deployment size exceeds the limit of 250 MB. Should i consider deploying elsewhere or change the approach? How do we handle questions pertaining to Devtools - creating input box etc. Thanks and Regards Shalini",

          "content": "I just want to know if you prefer using an existing language model application where we utilize an LLM (Large Language Model), train it, and format the output. For instance, I used the Gemini API key, integrated it with Python, and then formatted the results with the help of Copilot to achieve the desired outputs. Alternatively, do you want us to create a new LLM model and train it with questions from graded assignments? I’m curious about your preference. Additionally, would you like the LLM to provide specific answers regarding computer specifications, or should it give general specifications? For example, in Graded Assignment 1, there is a question about the editor: Visual Studio Code. Your editor is the most important tool in your arsenal; that’s where you’ll spend most of your time, so make sure you’re comfortable with it. Visual Studio Code is, by far, the most popular code editor today. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you’ll likely work with others who use VS Code, so having some exposure is beneficial. To get started, you can watch these introductory videos (totaling 35 minutes) from the Visual Studio Docs: Getting Started: Set up and learn the basics of Visual Studio Code (7 min) Code Editing: Learn how to edit and run code in VS Code (3 min) Productivity Tips: Become a VS Code power user with these productivity tips (4 min) Personalize: Personalize VS Code to make it yours with themes (2 min) Extensions: Add features, themes, and more to VS Code with extensions (4 min) Debugging: Get started with debugging in VS Code (6 min) Version Control: Learn how to use Git version control in VS Code (3 min) Customize: Learn how to customize your settings and keyboard shortcuts in VS Code (6 min) AI Editors: Copilot, Cursor Note: AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help you write code faster. These tools are built on top of VS Code and have become standard in every developer’s toolkit. Please make sure to use them. To install and run Visual Studio Code, open your Terminal (or Command Prompt) and type code -s, then press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below. What is the output of code -s? The output of code -s cannot be universally answered because it depends on the user’s system and the specific version of VS Code installed. The question requests the output of a command that is unique to each user. As for the part about getting answers from the LLM model, I believe that may require using an AI agent. I am currently searching for a solution for this, and I would like to know your thoughts on it. image1214×831 34.8 KB",

Here, the image is take from some url. For example. in GA2, q2, the image displayed is taken from https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png.

Will this table be in the “question” attribute of curl or “file” attribute Jivraj: In last question of GA5 there is only one file(image), table is not coming through file, it will be kept same for project2. so, can I assume that the table will be given as a html element in the “question” attribute and the image in the “file” attribute?",

I am facing issue with zip file extraction function which is in many GA1 questions. e.g., for GA1 Q15, if I use 7-zip to extract files, it shows the correct total size when using Postman for local server. If I use python built-in function, it calculates a different value (which is incorrect). So, I used 7-zip. But I (with help from copilot agent) am not able to make 7-zip work on the vercel deployment. Can we just hard code the answers to GA1 questions, or is there a way to take answer from local server and use it for response in vercel (sorry, it doesn’t even make sense to me, but a lot of things are hard to understand anyway)? Or how do we resolve this 7-zip issue. Python built-in extraction did not work correctly even after hours of trying.. I have another question. Due to lack of time, if I just submit the Project 2, with question/answers to GA1, (and if these all work as expected on vercel), how much approx score can we get if I am not able to do other GAs at all for Project 2. Edit after posting: I can hard code questions and other answers from GA2 upto GA4 (I missed GA5, so don’t have those answers). Thank you.",

But since the files are not identical for all students, this issue needs to be addressed. The file is just 341kb. it should take less than a second. So you do not have to pre download this file. Only very large ones that are not parameterised you can have a hard copy of. lakshaygarg654: In GA4 Q2, my task is to retrieve movie information from IMDb for all films with a rating between 3 and 5. I am scraping the correct movie names(for example 6th movie in given image), but the portal is accepting them differently. All movie names are provided in English, but the portal seems to be accepting some titles in other languages—Spanish, Dutch, I believe. Questions that require manual intervention will be graded very liberally. In other words those questions will not have as strict a grading criteria as in the GA portal. lakshaygarg654: In GA4 Q10, very few students were able to solve the question using LLMs or Python during the assignment. Most of us ended up solving it manually. At that time, @carlton sir had mentioned that the question would be revised. Here is the thread link for reference. How should we handle this question now? Same as above. Kind regards",

Kindly verify these points before evaluation. Questions Requiring Manual Intervention / Portal-Side Issue GA3 Q8 Issue: The question doesn’t mention all required queries. Although all mentioned queries were added, the portal seems to check for additional queries not stated, resulting in an incorrect answer flag. GA3 Q9 Issue: This question asks to create an LLM prompt, but upon submission, a pop-up requests the AIPROXY_TOKEN. Clarification needed: How are we supposed to handle token-based inputs for evaluation? GA4 Q2 & Q10 Issue: Previously encountered issues have been resolved. Reference: GA4 Q2 and Q10 resolution Output Formatting (Multiple Questions) Issue: When using plain text, the answer is accepted. However, in JSON format, newline characters (\\n) and backslashes are added. Note: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {“answer”: “result”}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal. Vercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment Questions Issue: Some deployment-related questions require a **live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok. Clarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated? Deployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday’s Session) Please include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues: Platform Capability for GA Tasks Which cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably? Note: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage. File Upload Example via Platform API Request: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app. This would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input. General Observations on GA1-5 Output Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine. However, about 20% either have portal-side issues or deployment-related problems. Kindly review these points before final evaluation, and let us know if any additional clarification is required from our side.",

The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system. To automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page’s availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10–20 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process—from initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live—takes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine. However, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly—before the GitHub Pages site is actually live—resulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a 502 Bad Gateway error, likely due to Azure’s request timeout limitations. The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform’s allowed response duration. GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a 502 Bad Gateway error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure’s execution time limit. Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem. Currently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably. Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point. I am not certain if alternative platforms will work consistently across all questions, and making such a change could introduce failures in other parts of the assignment where Azure performs well.

          "content": "@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Final Thoughts on Project 2 Project 2 has been a valuable yet challenging experience. I’d like to share a few reflections—not as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations. Organization & Structure: The project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I’m not blaming anyone—just sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback. Deployment & Portal Limitations: There are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning. Time Constraints: Balancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments. Sessions & Support: The sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward. Deployment Variability: Each GA’s questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably. Effort Acknowledgment: I sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors—it’s clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it’s also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail—even the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment. Feasibility in the Given Timeline: Even for someone with a technical background, it’s difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn’t always feasible before the deadline. I genuinely hope someone is able to complete all 57 questions successfully—I’d love to learn from their experience and solutions. Again, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know—I’m happy to edit or delete the post if needed. Thank you for the learning opportunity",

When calling the API, should we pass the .gz file directly, or will the API accept a Google Drive link from which it can download the .gz file? Specifically, will the API call be structured as follows? Essentialy, will the API call look like so? curl -X POST “http://127.0.0.1:5000” -H “Content-Type: multipart/form-data” -F \"question=Bandwidth Analysis for Regional Contents - anand.net is a personal website that had region-specific music content. One of the site’s key sections is tamilmp3, which hosts music files and is especially popular among the local audience. The website is powered by robust Apache web servers that record detailed access logs. These logs are essential for understanding user behavior, server load, and content engagement. By analyzing the server’s Apache log file, the author can identify heavy users and take measures to manage bandwidth, improve site performance, or even investigate potential abuse. Your Task: This GZipped Apache log file has 258,074 rows. Each row is an Apache web log entry for the site s-anand.net in May 2024. Each row has these fields: IP: The IP address of the visitor. Remote logname: The remote logname of the visitor. Typically ‘-’. Remote user: The remote user of the visitor. Typically ‘-’. Time: The time of the visit. E.g. [01/May/2024:00:00:00 +0000]. Note that this is not quoted, and you need to handle this. Request: The request made by the visitor. E.g. GET /blog/ HTTP/1.1. It has three space-separated parts: (a) Method: The HTTP method. E.g. GET. (b) URL: The URL visited. E.g. /blog/. (c) Protocol: The HTTP protocol. E.g. HTTP/1.1. Status: The HTTP status code. If 200 <= Status < 300, it is a successful request. Size: The size of the response in bytes. E.g. 1234. Referer: The referer URL. E.g. https://s-anand.net/. User agent: The browser used. This will contain spaces and might have escaped quotes. Vhost: The virtual host. E.g. s-anand.net. Server: The IP address of the server. The fields are separated by spaces and quoted by double quotes (‘-’). Unlike CSV files, quoted fields are escaped via \\\" and not ‘-’. (This impacts 41 rows.) All data is in the GMT-0500 timezone, and the questions are based on this same timezone. Filter the Log Entries: Extract only the requests where the URL starts with /tamilmp3/. Include only those requests made on the specified 2024-05-23. Aggregate Data by IP: Sum the ‘Size’ field for each unique IP address from the filtered entries. Identify the Top Data Consumer: Determine the IP address that has the highest total downloaded bytes. Report the total number of bytes that this IP address downloaded. Across all requests under tamilmp3/ on 2024-05-23, how many bytes did the top IP address (by volume of downloads) download?\" -F “file=@s-anand.net-May-2024.gz” I would appreciate your clarification on whether the .gz file should be directly included in the API request or if a Google Drive link should be provided instead. Thank you for your time and assistance.",

          "content": "lakshaygarg654: GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a 502 Bad Gateway error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure’s execution time limit. Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem. @carlton I watched the last session. In that session, regarding the specific PDF question, you mentioned that the PDF is the same for everyone, so it can be preprocessed beforehand. However, I checked and found that the PDF is actually different for each user. So, we need to fetch it from the API endpoint. How should we handle the timeout issue on the deployment platform? I even tried upgrading the plan, but it didn’t help. @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj Also, many questions and doubts were addressed in the last two sessions. I can improve a lot and add the remaining questions, but the constraint is the 31st March deadline. Most students, including myself, will only get time after 30th March due to Viva and OPPE. It would be really helpful if the TDS team could extend the deadline. I believe it would strike a good balance—team made us wait for the Project 1 results, but extending the Project 2 deadline would make up for that for some extent. Its request nothing else.",

I have developed a mini chatbot backend using vicky_server.py, which handles question matching and execution internally, producing appropriate responses. My mini chatbot is capable of creating its own API using REST and can manage tasks such as image compression, repository management, workflows, and web scraping related to graded assignments. It can even calculate total marks for subjects like physics and convert PDFs into markdown content. Additionally, it is capable of downloading the Llama model and creating a tunnel using ngrok. Essentially, it can address the first four assignment questions. However, there are some limitations to this project. Currently, it processes my local files instead of the uploaded PDFs. I am working on resolving this issue, but I have some confusion regarding the internal handling of uploaded files. When I pass a PDF or file through an upload method, how should the system proceed? I want to ensure that the file is treated as a PDF for the user rather than just being referenced as “question.pdf.” How can I effectively manage this problem? Furthermore, there is an issue with question matching. At times, the system incorrectly identifies questions containing the word “code” and executes first.py for GA1. Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project! Best regards, vicky kumar @s.anand @carlton @Saransh_Saini my model at Vicky kumar tds",

Specifically: Make sure you pass an Authorization header with dummy API key. Use gpt-4o-mini as the model. The first message must be a system message asking the LLM to analyze the sentiment of the text. Make sure you mention GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL as the categories. The second message must be exactly the text contained above. This test is crucial for DataSentinel Inc. as it validates both the API integration and the correctness of message formatting in a controlled environment. Once verified, the same mechanism will be used to process genuine customer feedback, ensuring that the sentiment analysis module reliably categorizes data as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. This reliability is essential for maintaining high operational standards and swift response times in real-world applications. Note: This uses a dummy httpx library, not the real one. You can only use: response = httpx.get(url, **kwargs) response = httpx.post(url, json=None, **kwargs) response.raise_for_status() response.json() [quote=\"22f3000819, post:173, topic:169029\"] The links to the website are hyperlinks in the questions.

For this, I have used two python scripts to get the answer, one written completely by me and another from someone else’s solution; both give the same answer - 2698 However, the portal says it’s incorrect. No modifications resulting in different answer are being accepted either and the modifications themselves seem to break the bounds of the question. Please check the scripts and tell me where I am going wrong. My script: import subprocess from datetime import datetime def isDay(dtobj, day): return dtobj.weekday() == day def isTime(dtobj, l, u): return l <= dtobj.hour < u step1 = subprocess.run(\"cat data | grep -i 'GET /telugu/'\", capture_output=True, shell=True, text=True) subprocess.run(\"rm -f forstep2.txt\", shell=True) with open('forstep2.txt', 'a') as f: for line in step1.stdout.splitlines(): try: status = int(line.split()[8]) except Exception as e: status = 400 if 200 <= status < 300: f.write(line + '\\n') step2 = subprocess.run(\"cat forstep2.txt | cut -d ' ' -f4\", capture_output=True, shell=True, text=True) count = 0 for line in step2.stdout.splitlines(): log_datetime = datetime.strptime(line.strip('['), \"%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S\") if(isDay(log_datetime, 0) and isTime(log_datetime, 11, 20)): count += 1 count I had extracted and uploaded the data after extraction using gzip into colab and then executed the script.

For 259.7 to 351.8 seconds, it is taking around 1.5 mins, but it is giving the correct answer. So I request you to shorten the length of the audio or increase the request timeout or both in moderation. Question —> the “question” sent to the api will have the youtube video link, right? Or since the video is same for everyone, can I just have the audio file ready in the project? Will the api be tested against any YouTube video other than the Mystery Story Audiobook link given in the GA question?

Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don’t think so that they really made any effort in our course. In project-2 also, we need solutions for all graded assignments and so many students request for solutions but our the great teachers ignores the request and didn’t provide the solutions. I think they provide the projects whatever comes in their dreams during sleeping. In weekly study material, don’t have their notes, even they have a very few videos made by them, they just render to other YouTuber’s Youtube videos and online websites. Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything. Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \". I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. But on extending the deadline of project-2 just only for one day, their evaluation will be late. In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. It is our tales it is my right to get solutions for every weekly assignment, but don’t ask them to make efforts. Just pay and do assignments at own risk even you have not understand anything from the copy-pasted material. Just use AI’s or read whatever and wherever you want to read. It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term. Thankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’.",

I agree it is stessful, my whole team were in a 9-hour g-meet call on Saturday night. but we have found solutions, shared ideas, try-outs, made fun of each other. but at the end of the day we all agree that we have learnt lots of new things. Regarding Project1 delay: if we think, atleast 1GB of docker image per students for 700+ students. even if parallalize the execution 5 students at a time you still need a very powerfull system to download and amount of data downloading etc… At the end of the day we got a very good result and report with logs to verify for GA’s: it is upto you to copy solutions or learn something out of each GA sections All in all I am happy with the course.",

          "content": "Dear Shahzada, You joined Discourse almost a year ago Jun 8th, 2023. In all that time you have read 832 posts. And never interacted with anyone on discourse. You finally decided to interact once and that was today and this is your first post (your second if we count that you deleted your first post) The first step to receiving help is communication. If you do not communicate, no one can help you. 23f2002668: What is this going on? Is it joking? I am not sure what your question is. I am not sure what you are referring to. Please be clear in your questions. 23f2002668: Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? We have made several hours of videos on Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself. 23f2002668: I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. Not sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared) 23f2002668: They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? Yes these were explained if you either took part in any live session or watched the recorded video 23f2002668: And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? I am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks. 23f2002668: It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Project 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words: Create a server api that receives a request. The request would be any question from the first 5 GAs. The response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page. Multiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions. 23f2002668: Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? Since this is your first post, you’ve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process. If you want solutions, there are several options: Ask for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it) Collaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration) Join live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked) Watch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment) 23f2002668: They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. This is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting. The biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs… with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning. 23f2002668: Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. If you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video. But feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up. What are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that. I absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you. 23f2002668: They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything. Reading documentation is a skill you have to pick up. Having said that, we have always explained something that students have asked. Just ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world. Now is a good time to start. 23f2002668: Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \" That is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic. 23f2002668: I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? They have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time. Luckily for you, our first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be). 23f2002668: The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. If you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion. 23f2002668: In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. Anand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution? Also if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script. But validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime. You can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback. 23f2002668: It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term. Thankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’. I am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither respect nor kindness is evident in your post. But thank you for your feedback. One final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score. And when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve. Kind regards, TDS team",

          "content": "Hi, I have a few things to say My background : I have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term. My Initial Disappointments with this Course In one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction): The video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended. Here, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn’t like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph ROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful. There are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily. Why did I fail? Last Term I dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn’t practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon. This term. I made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn’t allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn’t submit both the projects. In both the terms I didn’t collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn’t earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair. Me Understanding about the Course Now This one line changed my view about ROE. On another topic What does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning. I am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don’t know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough. I scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS. Now I realize that I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time. In MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing SKLearn. Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE. This course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an implicit way. This is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code. I have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks I have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc. I am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt. From the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn’t do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn’t cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects. Since this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too. Thanks to @s.anand , @carlton , @Jivraj and @Saransh_Saini Just two suggestions I feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites. While introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained. Also, address few questions in the video itself which are likely to be asked by us.",

          "content": ": From Problem to Platform: Building “Vicky” – A Smart Data Science Assistant for TDS @ IIT Madras Project Demo Website: https://app.algsoch.tech During our college course Tool for Data Science (TDS) at IIT Madras, we were tasked with a challenging but exciting project: to build a platform that can take in natural language questions and execute corresponding solutions through an API. The Mission: Create a tool that behaves like a chatbot, accepts user queries (text or file-based) via web or API, processes them intelligently, executes the appropriate code, and returns accurate results—like a real data science assistant. The Journey: From Fails to Final At first, the natural choice was to try LLM agents—they sounded magical. But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries. Then I thought—what if I manually mapped questions and answers using a static JSON structure? That quickly broke when users passed different parameters, different files, or queried in non-standard formats like “code -s” or “code -v”. The next idea: write individual Python scripts per question from our Graded Assignments (GA1–GA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable. The Breakthrough: Dynamic Function Mapping After multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture: Centralized engine in vicky_server.py Uses regex-based pattern matching to detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solution Each solution is a structured Python function like ga1_first_solution(query=None) Supports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and more Acts like a mini compiler for data science tools Presenting Vicky – The Mini Chatbot for TDS Vicky is a smart, modular chatbot built specifically for Tool for Data Science at IIT Madras. It’s packed with real functionality—not just templates. Key Features: Graded Assignment Solver Handles dynamic, real-world questions from GA1 to GA5 like: code -s / code -v → VS terminal commands Create FastAPI API for CSV with filtering/searching GitHub automation: repo creation, GitHub Actions setup Data cleaning, scraping from IMDb, image compression File Upload with Query Matching Users can upload a file (CSV, JSON, Excel) and ask file-specific queries. The system understands context and dynamically links the query to the uploaded file. HTML Viewer + Base64 Decoder View any website in rendered & source format using CORS proxy Upload Base64 string → Get original image back Webhooks Integration Live notifications via Discord & Slack whenever /api endpoints are accessed Monitors server status (online/offline) and sends real-time updates LLM Download + Auto Tunneling Downloads LLaMA models Dynamically finds available ports Creates and exposes tunneled endpoints Live Web UI at app.algsoch.tech Ask any TDS question Upload and query with files Image decoder Graded assignment slider navigation HTML viewer API health status Built With: FastAPI for blazing fast APIs Regex & Pattern Matching for dynamic input detection GitHub Copilot + my Python debugging and architectural thinking Full webhook and status monitoring system Modular backend (vicky_server.py) and web frontend (vicky_app.py) I want to extend a huge thank you to @s.anand for their guidance on this project. I’ve learned what prompt engineering is and how we can leverage large language models (LLMs). One interesting takeaway is that while these technologies won’t replace our jobs—especially for those who understand programming—they will create new job opportunities instead. Now I am capable of how fastapi work and more things and how to structure code and how to design code and most important what to think for project",

For instance, we submitted our response at 11:30 PM on March 31st, and someone else submitted theirs at 11:45 PM. Even after editing our response the next day, our entry still appears above theirs. We just wanted to clarify: Will responses edited or submitted on April 1st still be considered, given that the form remains open? If not, is there any way we can show proof of our original submission? Currently, we have email confirmations for both the initial and the edited responses.

I mentioned the exactly correct URL of my app in the form but the evaluation logs show three different types of URL to which request was made. As I mentioned in the form, my url is of the format “https://…/api/” and allows only POST requests. The app was supposed to allow POST requests and I allowed only POST requests, so GET requests even to correct url resulted in 405 response When POST requests were actually made, two wrong urls were used for all the POST requests a. http://…/api/ → resulted in 302 response b. https://…/api → resulted in a 307 whereas the url I gave was of the format “https://…/api/” The logs from Cloud Run image982×552 133 KB As you can see from the above logs, all POST requests made to my app have the wrong url, some have only http and some end with “/api” instead of “/api/”, both of which do not match with the correct url I gave in the Google Form (screenshot attached below). image831×645 41.7 KB I request you to re-evaluate my project 2 with the correct url exactly as I had submitted in the Google Form.

This is the first term where we have had students deploy solutions that require significant compute resources on our end to evaluate. So there was always going to be hickups. But i think that we have delivered an equally enriching learning experience as a result which is enough to land you an actual job.

The previous endpoint is no longer accessible, and the new one now serves as the API endpoint.

This behavior is typical of free-tier deployments on Render, and I assure you that the application functions correctly in both Podman and Linux environments. Upon reviewing my Render logs, I could not find any indication that the project was accessed or evaluated during the expected activation time. To ensure smooth accessibility, I have also deployed the same GitHub repository on Railway and submitted that link as well. If possible, I kindly request either of the following: Re-evaluation using the Railway link I provided, or Re-evaluation using the Render link, with allowance for the 50–60 second activation time. Your consideration and understanding in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if any further clarification or information is needed. Thank you for your support and guidance.",

I came to know that many students have received an email stating that the re-evaluation for Project 2 will be conducted today between 11 PM and 2 AM. However, I have not received any such communication on my end. I would like to bring to your attention that I actively helped several peers deploy their servers on Vercel and resolve various issues, and many of them received marks as high as 80. Unfortunately, my own record still shows as “Absent,” despite the fact that I submitted the Google Form well before the deadline and my server has been live and running for over two weeks. For your verification, I am attaching screenshots of my GitHub repository and the Vercel deployment dashboard, which clearly show the deployment. I sincerely request you to kindly consider this issue. This situation has caused significant mental stress, especially as I had already faced a grading issue in Project 1. The anxiety and uncertainty around my Project 2 score have negatively affected my focus during the end-term exam and viva for other projects as well. Receiving a zero in this project would only further impact my overall performance and morale, despite the genuine effort I have put in. I genuinely hope for a positive response and a fair re-evaluation. Thank you very much for your time and understanding. api link : https://tds-proj2f.vercel.app/ git949×580 62.4 KB",

I’m currently running my server and trying to access the API hosted at: https://sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app/api/ However, I’m encountering the following error: curl: (6) Could not resolve host: sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app After some investigation, I found that the issue is related to DNS resolution. The API becomes accessible when using public DNS services like Google (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1). This suggests that the current deployment environment may be using a restricted or unreliable DNS resolver, which causes access issues on some networks (e.g., Jio). Suggested Fix: To ensure reliable access for all students, could you please consider updating the deployment or testing environment to use a public DNS provider? Recommended options: Google DNS: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4 Cloudflare DNS: 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1 This can typically be configured via Docker settings or the environment’s networking configuration. Alternate Option: If the DNS change isn’t possible at the moment, I kindly request that you evaluate my project using the previously deployed endpoint instead: https://tds-project-2-pnlm.onrender.com/api/ Please note that this endpoint may take 50 to 60 seconds to respond, as it’s hosted on a platform with a cold start delay — but it is fully functional and provides the correct outputs. Both endpoints are currently active and return identical results. Thank you so much for your time and support — I truly appreciate the effort you’re putting into helping us succeed in this course!

I notice that I am not providing a preloaded answer when this question arises. Instead, it creates a new repository and an HTML file, then deploys it on GitHub. Initially, it presents a URL, but I understand that your server checks to verify whether the URL contains valid HTML. This verification process takes time, which can lead to an incorrect response when checking the URL right after deployment. At that moment, the URL might not display the HTML content or be verified by your server, even though eventually, the deployment is successful and the URL is correct. Please keep in mind that publishing to GitHub requires some time; it’s not feasible to expedite this process drastically, to my knowledge. I checked and noted that this question has been asked recently. Additionally, I believe the image may show your server’s IP address. Thank you! 10000638561920×858 139 KB",

Moreover, if I omit either field from the form-data, the server returns the exact validation error mentioned in the re-evaluation report, which makes sense. Based on this behavior and the details in the shared report, I’d like to confirm: during the re-evaluation, was the request payload indeed sent with both question and file fields included in the form-data?

As per the official project instructions, our API was clearly required to handle POST requests at /api/ with multipart/form-data. Nowhere in the documentation was it mentioned that the API should handle GET requests. However, during evaluation, GET requests seem to be made to the endpoint, leading to 405 Method Not Allowed errors. These errors are expected behavior for an API that is properly built to accept only POST, exactly as per the project guidelines. Therefore, I request that the evaluation team only test using POST requests as originally instructed. Penalizing students because of unnecessary GET requests would be unfair and incorrect based on the project requirements. Please ensure that evaluation happens strictly according to the provided instructions.",

Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)’” } What Was Expected: The question required developing a script that: Parses a large, deeply nested JSON log file, and Counts how many times a specific key — represented by XF — appears in the JSON structure. It was explicitly stated that: Only key matches for XF are to be counted, not values. The file to be used was: E:\\data science tool\\GA5\\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json What I Did: I used the correct approach, parsing the nested JSON file and counting how many times the key XF appeared throughout the structure. Here’s the actual response I got using this cURL command: curl -X POST https://app.algsoch.tech/api/ \\ -H “accept: application/json” \\ -F “question=…How many times does XF appear as a key?” \\ -F “file=@E:\\data science tool\\GA5\\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json” API Output:{“answer”:“14602”} This indicates that my logic worked correctly and the key XF appeared 14,602 times, exactly as intended. What Went Wrong on API Side: The API returned a parsing error, indicating: “invalid literal for int() with base 10: ‘Error: Invalid JSON in the file…’” However: My file was valid JSON, properly parsed. The actual issue seems to be on the API’s side — possibly mishandling the file read or decoding before passing it to the evaluator. It may have expected an integer but received a string-wrapped error or non-integer data, causing it to crash. Insight: If the original question was about counting the key XF, my solution was 100% correct. However, if the question dynamically changed the key name or added extra criteria (e.g., only count if value == true, or only under a certain section), then the result might differ. But from the default XF-focused question, my logic and result match perfectly.",

I got only 5 marks sir. Can you please check my code once sir and verify it as I have written the code and the dockerfile is running successfully. Project-2 Evaluation Regarding project 2 also, I have uploaded my code in GitHub and deployed my app in Vercel. But, I got 0 sir. Can you check my code once again and verify it? According to the guidance given, I deployed my app through Vercel. The app got deployed but I am getting 404 Error, even after trying any troubleshooting method. Maybe, Vercel is in development stage. Sir, but I wrote the code and deployed, but I got 0 marks only. Please check it and guide me to get it corrected. Sir, due to the projects I got poor marks on TDS. Please, I request you to re-evaluate and give me correct marks. In anticipation of quick response Thank You",

I’m Vicky Kumar, a student from the Data Science and Applications program at IIT Madras. Over the last few months, I’ve built a personal project called “Vicky App” — a smart assistant platform specifically designed to help students in courses like TDS,. The system is capable of: Accurately solving over 90% of assignment-style questions using regex and phonetic matching Dynamically executing the right code logic based on the student’s input Processing uploaded files such as Excel, PDF, CSV, and JSON Delivering instant answers, completely independent of ChatGPT or any external LLM You can test the platform here: https://app.algsoch.tech What’s in it for students: They type their question, and the backend executes the correct solution automatically Especially helpful for GA preparation, understanding problem logic, and reducing repetitive workload I’ve made it free for the first 3 questions After that, students can access the full platform for just ₹199/month, which helps me cover system maintenance and hosting costs My Humble Request: This is a tool I’ve built with immense effort and love for this course, and I genuinely believe it can benefit many students. To sustain the platform — hosting, APIs, file management, and backend orchestration — I’ve introduced a small paid model after a free trial. I would be extremely grateful if you could test it once and, if you find it helpful, consider sharing it with upcoming students or mentioning it in a Moodle announcement. It’s built by an IIT Madras student, for IIT Madras students — with the sole goal of making their learning smoother, faster, and smarter. Thank you so much for your time and support. Warm regards, Vicky Kumar B.S. Data Science and Applications, IIT Madras npdimagine@gmail.com | +91 8383848219 Portfolio | LinkedIn It’s a tool built by a fellow IITM student, with deep respect for the academic rigor of this program — not to replace learning, but to accelerate it. Please let me know if you’d like a walkthrough, or if any suggestions for improvements arise. Warm regards, Vicky Kumar B.S.

Out of the 4 options provided, 3 options are correct in my case both for Q1 & Q2, but both these questions are single-choice questions. Kindly look into it and help us out @carlton ! I guess for both Q1 & Q2, we need to find the option that is having stronger correlation (positive/negative). Please correct me if I am wrong. Any updates on these? I am too facing the same issue. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini In GA6 for first 2 questions 3 out of 4 options are correct. Even the question is not clearly asking anything. Kindly suggest are we supposed to select the wrong one image2083×575 47.6 KB Kindly update us regarding the status of Q1 & Q2 @carlton @Jivraj @Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini Dear TDS Team, There are multiple issues in Graded Assignment 6 that require urgent attention: Questions 1 and 2, along with their options, are ambiguous. In Questions 3 and 4, I am unable to obtain an exact answer that matches any of the given options, despite trying multiple approaches, including the Excel regression method and other models in a Google Colab file. The data for Question 10 is missing. I attempted to run the shapefile in QGIS, but it resulted in an error. Additionally, I searched for the shapefile of New York roads on official websites, but their servers are currently under maintenance. The assignment deadline is approaching, but these issues remain unresolved. Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution as soon as possible. Thank you for your support. Yes, there are no specifics in Q1 to Q4 and are quite ambiguous. For instance: forecast the 2027 resale value of the Hero - HF Deluxe in Gujarat, using historical data. but is this talking about the average resale value as no input features are specified? Let’s wait for their response. I submitted nearby option for Q3 and Q4 @Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini Can you please provide any update ASAP as the deadline for this GA coincides with Quiz 2. With many ambiguities unresolved it’s hard to solve this and study for Quiz 2 (and do offline college work even though that’s not your problem). Thanks Hi @all Question intends you to select most correlated one. Select option which is absolute highest. @Jivraj - Can you please check answer choices for Q7 for GA6 where no choices are matching with the answer. The answer is coming to around 11.5 kms which is 11500 meters. Q.A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Pine Pines Junction : (26.5596,-99.5336) ;Maple Fields Station : (26.4212,-99.4597);South Glen Crossing : (26.5962,-99.5243);Cedar Creek Retreat : (26.56,-99.4519) & Central Command Post Location: (26.4644,-99.4771) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Pine Pines Junction. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance image1318×377 34.2 KB what to do if 3 options have same value -0.04 and all are correct? @carlton @Jivraj My question 7 for GA6 is : A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance Whose options provided are : 10418 meters 12287 meters 10965 meters 11149 meters However, after trying all methods out there my distance comes out to be 6873 meters, I selected 10418 as the answer (closest approximation to 6873 meters) I assume that the question must have been central command post to summit shores village (whose answer turns out to be 12287 meters) Kindly look into the question, and let me know about the same (the destination from central command post) Have you succeeded in running the shape file for Q10? It seems to have some error. @lakshaygarg654 No, I use google to get MTFCC code for given road segment and after that mtfcc pdf to classify that road segment. I downloaded the complete shape file zip from the census.gov site. Here is the link: https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2024/PRISECROADS/tl_2024_36_prisecroads.zip It works fine in QGIS. @lakshaygarg654 they have not provide all the files needed to read that shp file in the question . but your link includes them. thanks… I tried to access shapefile from official website 4-5 days ago, but server was under maintenance. I will check again Q10 after quiz 2. Thanks for sharing. My question 9 for GA6 is : @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Screenshot 2025-03-15 205444878×668 38.1 KB Screenshot 2025-03-15 2054561333×366 45.8 KB I solved it in colab but options are getting mismatched there…kindly clarify this issue.. for the above question the options are None of these are matching and answer is around 11.5 kms 3848 meters 6265 meters 4110 meters 5106 meters For 7th Question in GA6 I got the answer 14265.93 Meters but the option I have in 7th are 6069 meters 7687 meters 6106 meters 7035 meters @carlton @Jivraj @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini for question 4, i have tried =forecast and also =forecast.ets, both of them are not working. There are two columns for years. One is year of manufacturing, another is year of registration. which one to take. for question 7, none of the options match. I am selecting the MOST ACCURATE among the given options. Hope, it is correct Can anyone help me out on how to approach and solve the 10th question please!? Check the distances of other locations from the central location. One student found Question 7 of the GA6 Option Set based on the distances of other points, which do not match the requirements of Question 7. i have the same issue yes i have the same issue and i got the same answer and am give the same options @carlton sir what to do? @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini For 7th Question in GA6 I got the answer 14265.9275 Meters but the option I have in 7th are 6069 meters 7687 meters 6106 meters 7035 meters Hello Sir, Can you please check if this is the right answer. As per email received from @carlton sir we should select the absolute maximum value. image978×393 23.3 KB Example : If we get answers as -0.3 and 0.2 then -0.3 is the right answer as it’s absolut value is maximum. For the first question the correlation matrix is as follows, image748×431 17.5 KB So shouldn’t it be -0.13? Thanks for the colour picture. If you read the aforementioned email… Screenshot 2025-03-17 at 9.09.55 am1760×632 65.4 KB Kind regards (in colour ) Thank you sir. i have got questions 1 and 2 both marked as 0. image962×459 29.1 KB In my case Please note the above two questions are asked to calculate pearson correlation coefficient for KTM brand and for maharashtra and Karnataka states.

Please check the question below and the haversine distance for the given post comes to around 11.5 kms which is not matccing with any of the options and I have selected the closest answer. please check and let me know. image935×529 40.1 KB @carlton @Jivraj I did raise the question 2 days before the GA6 Deadline and doing so again after being marked as incorrect My question 7 was A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance 10418 meters 12287 meters 10965 meters 11149 meters Whose right answer turned out 6873, however the answer pushed is 12287 meters, which is nowhere near the closest options (it would’ve been correct if the destination was summit shores village which isn’t the case with this question) Also, my question 4 was : As an investment analyst monitoring motorcycle resale values, develop a forecasting model to predict future resale prices by brand and segment, considering seasonality and long-term trends. Specifically, forecast the 2027 resale value of the Kawasaki - Ninja 300 in Tamil Nadu, using historical data. 134483 94774 150666 199711 Whose correct option (through different methods and algorithms) was approximately closest to 94774 and again answer pushed is 150666 which again turns out to be incorrect So is the case with questions 1 and 2 (where answers aren’t pushed according to absolute values, but as conveyed earlier, I believe this shall be resolved) Kindly look into it Thanks and Regards @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini In Q4 , neither which regression model to use is given nor the what random state to use is given. I tried linear regression, random forest regression but it is giving answer which vary each time I compute, also, the option values are quite close. image1227×446 24 KB @all we are looking into problems with question 4, 6 and 10.

The data for Question 10 is missing. I attempted to run the shapefile in QGIS, but it resulted in an error. Additionally, I searched for the shapefile of New York roads on official websites, but their servers are currently under maintenance. The assignment deadline is approaching, but these issues remain unresolved. Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution as soon as possible. Thank you for your support.",

Specifically, forecast the 2027 resale value of the Kawasaki - Ninja 300 in Tamil Nadu, using historical data. 134483 94774 150666 199711 Whose correct option (through different methods and algorithms) was approximately closest to 94774 and again answer pushed is 150666 which again turns out to be incorrect So is the case with questions 1 and 2 (where answers aren’t pushed according to absolute values, but as conveyed earlier, I believe this shall be resolved) Kindly look into it Thanks and Regards",

Deadline: 2025-03-26T18:29:00Z Is it compulsory to use microsoft powerpoint? Can we use google slides? We will be using scripts to check the submissions. You will have to use PowerPoint. Kind regards Hi @carlton, I was working on GA7 as part of Task 4 in 7.1. In task 4.Sheet1, the columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. While I could extract Series ID and Item, I couldn’t locate Year, Month, or Value in the dataset. Could someone please assist me with this? image1393×657 67.8 KB There is another dataset provided for the other records. image1227×791 78.2 KB Monthly Price Indices file have those columns. @Jivraj In the GA 7.1 part it is said that we need data of which columns are but the dataset provided has no column named “Item” Thanks a lot for pointing out and sorry it’s my bad missed it. Item is there in other sheet we might have to join them to get items. We have to extract all id’s and their respective item from other sheet and add in first sheet with respect to id’s . @carlton Sir I don’t have Microsoft PowerPoint. What should I do ? Use the free version on Microsoft 365 Below items don’t have prices.

Although the assignment says 24 months (I assumed 2023 January to 2024 December) data, many items have prices for 2025 Jan as well. Monthly Price Indices for Segments (Two-year data) Shall I delete the records for which price is not available? image1290×648 53.1 KB @carlton @Jivraj How to give the access to power point slides with the edit option ? @carlton Can you please advise regarding the ga.7.2 as the The current top 5 countries by GDP in 2014 from the dataset are actually aggregated economic groups (not individual countries). can i proceed with that or I need to filter only the individual countries once i submitted the answers. but when i clicked on edit response and it deleted all the submitted answers. What to do in this case @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Hi Tanya, Both you responses have been recorded. So it has not been deleted. Its just the way google forms works, it does not reload your previous responses. Kind regards The question asked for top 5 countries. So that would be the approach for this question, not aggregated economic groups. Hi @carlton sir, I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email. Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded? 10000415651280×349 87.7 KB Hi Shambhavi, Thanks for the update. We will look into it. Thanks once again Sir, In case we are not provided access to view their respective sheets, we would have no option but to either leave the column blank or mark it as 0. However, if others have marked it differently based on their available information, there is a possibility that our responses may vary — potentially exceeding the permissible variance limit of ±33%. In such a scenario, would this mean we would not be eligible for the bonus? Additionally, it would be really helpful if a uniform approach or standard marking could be communicated for such cases where access is not granted. This would ensure consistency across all submissions and avoid discrepancies arising from random or subjective entries, which seems to be happening currently. If you are not provided access, contact the peer. Their email is there in the html file. It’s in the peers interest and yours. That’s an important aspect of GA7, it’s to get people to work together and collaborate. Peer reviews like the real world is going to be messy. The way to reduce the messiness is to communicate with one another. @carlton sir can you please clarify what do we have to write in google form if there is no submission? You have two options. Get in touch with the peer (you have their email address), this is the recommended approach. Or you could give them zero because you were not able to evaluate their submission.",

      "content": "@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj Dear TDS Team, I hope you are doing well. I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution. 1. Graded Assignments (GA) GA6 Doubts Unresolved: While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. (Thread link) GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. 2. Project Updates Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 2: There are multiple doubts posted in the Project 2 discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved? (thread link) 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. I appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response. Best regards, Lakshay tigertds212×148 6.99 KB @carlton It’s been over a month, and now an extra day has been taken as well—when will TDS Project 1 finally be released? The delay is getting excessive; some clarity on the timeline would be appreciated. lakshaygarg654: GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations. With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS. GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon. lakshaygarg654: Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing. Each and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway. lakshaygarg654: 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. You got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed. Kind regards We do not know yet. Please read reply to the original poster. Thanks, Kind regards Thank you for your response @carlton and for addressing our concerns. We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience. The reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next. We will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100. Meanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated. Looking forward to your response. Regards, Lakshay",

          "question": "@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj Dear TDS Team, I hope you are doing well. I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution. 1. Graded Assignments (GA) GA6 Doubts Unresolved: While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. (Thread link) GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. 2. Project Updates Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 2: There are multiple doubts posted in the Project 2 discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved? (thread link) 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. I appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response. Best regards, Lakshay",

The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations. With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS. GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon. lakshaygarg654: Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16.

We also tested it with our friends’ GA questions, and it’s working as expected. This project was a team effort by me and two friends [ @lakshaygarg654 and @23f2004637 ], and we are thrilled with the results post-deployment. I would love the opportunity to demonstrate our project to TA and Anand Sir in a Google Meet session on March 31st (since I have OPPE on the 29th and 30th). If you can spare some time for a quick look at our project, it would be awesome! Looking forward to your response. Hi @23f2005702 @lakshaygarg654 Firstly, congratulations on your success. And surely you can demonstrate your project. It would be great if you demonstrate it in today’s live session at 8pm. Otherwise next week is all about project 2 discussion. Thank you for the opportunity! However, I won’t be able to present the project in a public session as my Azure API URL would be exposed, and since it incurs costs per usage, I need to keep it secure. I’d prefer a private meet to demonstrate the project. Please let me know if that can be arranged. Looking forward to discussing it! That’s amazing @23f2005702 , so far I have completed till 44 Qs and deployed it on azure too !! Mine is solving around 40 correctly out of these 44 (checked with another user’s login on the portal). @Saransh_Saini I can’t join the meet since I’m out of station and don’t have PC access. I also have other coursework, so I’ll be available for a meet from the 31st onwards Congrats for your project mate! Just wanted to ask how did you frame your questions for the Graded Assignments? Cause that will help me complete mine. Thanks in advance",

We also tested it with our friends’ GA questions, and it’s working as expected. This project was a team effort by me and two friends [ @lakshaygarg654 and @23f2004637 ], and we are thrilled with the results post-deployment. I would love the opportunity to demonstrate our project to TA and Anand Sir in a Google Meet session on March 31st (since I have OPPE on the 29th and 30th). If you can spare some time for a quick look at our project, it would be awesome! Looking forward to your response.",

This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by @s.anand as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos you gave us. For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated. How to fix bugs in our scripts Create Pull requests to Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1 . Docker Image Architecture Issue Report If your Docker image was run on the wrong architecture, please fill out this form: Submit Report Bug fixes If you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix. So it is in your interest to look through our scripts and logs and identify bugs or anomalies. You might just go from 0 to heros. Kind regards, TDS Team What is the highest mark anyone has scored? Is it 22/20 @Carlton? How come me and my group used same code but some got 10 some 11 some 12? @carlton Please make clear what the average marks are, what highest marks are, and how the project will be evaulated. We are very close to the end semester exam, and we are still not clear on assignment and project marks. It is a bit frustrating to plan in such circumstances. You have to see the logs for that. We have shared the logs. Everyone was graded by the exact same code, so there is no partiality. Your code did not produce consistent results. I have noticed that my image was run on a x86_64 architecture ( I can see my email in the logs shared ) whereas I built this docker image on my mac which is ARM. This is why I can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the exec format error. This was never mentioned on which architecture machine, our images will be evaluated. I request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine. My evaluation log file is missing, although I followed all the steps to generate the docker image correctly, it’s showing the server didn’t start for 5 minutes but when I uploaded it, it was working fine. Please help me out sir, I worked hard on the project. I’ll get a zero, but I made the submissions correctly. Some other student also got the “server didn’t start in 5 minutes” but he has an evaluation log file. Please kindly help me out. My roll no. is 22f2001389 We will check and rerun on arm if we ran it on the wrong emulation. Any suggestions for my case sir ? I’m really tensed. 22f3002933: I have noticed that my image was run on a x86_64 architecture ( I can see my email in the logs shared ) whereas I built this docker image on my mac which is ARM.

Sir I haven’t received any mail regarding this Project1 marks. @Jivraj @carlton @carlton Sir , my Docker image is built on Macbook M1 which as you know uses ARM64 architecture . But evaluated with x86_64 which caused the exec format error due to cross platform compatibility issues . I am kindly requesting you to re-evaluate the project once again . This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: d0f14a872042 , but i had never provided this docker image then how it get evaluated, also none of the docker image created by me has this id. Please, look over it. Regards, Harsh Jaiswal 23f1001995 @carlton @Jivraj I wanted to kindly request if you could review the bonus additional tasks, as they were not reflected in the evaluation, despite being mentioned in the instructions. Apart from that I understand and accept my score overall, especially since I had hardcoded the folder paths in my prompt for some questions, which I believe led to those failures. Bonus: Additional tasks. We may pass additional tasks beyond the list above. If your code handles them correctly, you get 1 bonus mark per task.

I don’t understand why does it show like that. Please do check and help me out sir. Reg no. 24f1002633 I suspect there is something wrong with how the evaluation has been done. Although A1 task succeeded, all of my A tasks failed. I have checked my log file in all of the cases where a file is required it says file not found or directory not found error in the code, how can I check /data folder was provided to the program? @carlton @Jivraj , @carlton It was a good project, and I have obtained the log files. Upon reviewing the log files, I realized that they are unable to read the files. I checked my project on GitHub and discovered that I forgot to uncomment the line that defines the path using the os library. As a result, all file evaluations returned errors such as “can’t read the file.” I understand that this oversight was my mistake. However, is there any way to reevaluate the code by simply uncommenting that line? I believe the rest of the code is properly written, but due to this single comment, all the files remained unchecked or resulted in errors. Screenshot (177)1920×1080 206 KB Screenshot (179)1920×1080 199 KB Same here. I also dis not recieve any mail sir. I noticed that my Docker image was run on an x86_64 architecture (as indicated by my email in the shared logs), whereas I originally built it on my Mac (ARM architecture). Due to this mismatch, the image failed to run properly and resulted in an exec format error. Since there was no prior mention of the architecture on which our images would be evaluated, I request that my evaluation be conducted again on the appropriate machine. Please help as after doing it correctly getting 0 marks because of such an error feels wrong @23f2001975 we had to rely on docker telling us whether an image was arm or x86. So thats why we just did what docker software told us. If it classified an image as arm then we ran it on arm. If it did not then we ran it on x86. Thats why we need students to look through the logs and identify issues so that we can make sure you get the correct evaluation. If students notify us their image is actually arm based, then we will run it on arm. So dont worry, just inform us of any discrepancy as well as bugs. Our evaluation might not be perfect, there may be bugs. If students can precisely create bug reports then we can take that into consideration when evaluating students as well. The benefit being you might get extra marks because of the bug fix. We have a script that looks at this discourse post each day and tells us who requires a fresh evaluation. So we will check your image on arm. Kind regards image633×197 4.25 KB This is a screenshot of my docker log file. This works if you pass the actual value of the airproxy token at the command line while pulling the docker image. Please do look into this as I’ve put a lot of effort into this. Thank you Regards, 23f3002677 @cartlon Same issue. My image was also run on a x86_64 architecture. I too built on my mac which is ARM (M1 Processor). I too can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the exec format error and Evaluation log file is MISSING. Can you please rerun the image on ARM based You have a misspelling in your environment variable, thats why it failed. We do pass the token to your docker exactly as specified in Project 1 page. image633×197 5.21 KB Kind regards You have to identify the exact bug for your claim to be considered. Thats why we have provided you with the scripts and the logs. You might get lots of marks. Its in your interest to identify the bug. Kind regards @carlton @Jivraj what do I do sir am seriously clueless and heartbroken rn pls help atleast for A tasks we should get it We demoed in the live session the complete process of how to dockerise your project so that it can be run anywhere. Running on your local machine is not a sufficient criteria for passing the evaluation. It is absolutely vital for students to understand deployment. This is a critical skill for anyone who is serious about working in this field. Also just check if yours is an arm based image or x86. Sometimes that makes a difference. For us there is no way to know other than docker software telling us. As it turns out several students had an arm based image but docker did not tell us that. So we will re run those. If yours has been run on the wrong emulation then we will re run. Kind regards @carlton I encountered an HTTP 500 error with the following detail: { \"detail\": \"'choices'\" } This issue appears across all tasks, even though they were running fine before submission. I suspect there might be a problem with APIPROXY_TOKEN. Could you please look into this? Additionally, my solution is very similar to the one shared by the System Commands team in their email. Screenshot 2025-03-29 1033271511×749 29 KB We have given you the evaluation scripts. Identify where exactly you believe the bug is. Just guesses is not going to get you extra marks. You have to give us something specific. Kind regards @Jivraj sir please kindly look into it. Please re-evaluate my image, everything was working fine it is an issue with the docker image. Please re-evaluate it sir and please guide me as what to do I encountered the same issue with evaluate.py. However, since you previously advised against coding strictly with evaluate.py, I didn’t pursue it further. Now, I’m concerned—how is this a mistake?

I am reaching out with deep frustration and concern regarding the evaluation of my project. I have worked tirelessly on this for almost two weeks, dedicating day and night to ensure that the tasks were executed correctly. During my own testing, I was able to get at least 7 out of 10 A tasks working as expected. However, after the evaluation, I was informed that none of the tasks were executed properly, which was quite shocking! Given the effort and time I have put in, I kindly request you to review my project once more. I am more than willing to demonstrate the functionality in real time to clarify any issues or misunderstandings. Please let me know if there is a possibility to discuss this further, as I genuinely believe my work deserves another review. @carlton, Jivraj said, “We will discuss internally if we can do something about it.” I understand this well. The output from my server is slightly different, but it still achieves over 95% accuracy. Please do consider it. Hi @Pritul_raut No, we won’t reevaluating it. Hi @22f2001389 File \"/app/app.py\", line 4, in <module> from tasksA import * ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tasksA' The error occurs because Python cannot find the tasksA module.

Thank you sir What to do now sir ? Is there no way to fix this now ? I can change the docker file and overwrite the docker image if you allow me to do so. image474×474 41.7 KB Figure out the problem in our script and do a pull request to it, we will fix it if it’s a valid bug. Jivraj: Create Pull requests to Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1 . We looked at your script and there are errors in it. It doesn’t follow what we mentioned in live sessions. Line number 81 of your app.py subprocess.run([\"uv\", \"run\", script_name, \"--root\", \"./data\"] + args, check=True) which creates a data directory inside app directory but evaluate.py expects data directory to be in root directory. @Jivraj @carlton I’m writing here to express my concerns regarding the evaluation of my TDS Project-1. Also, kindly pardon me for the long message. I have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday. These are the detailed point wise concerns : I at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it’s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2½ weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course. By this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn’t receive a reply. I understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them. I also didn’t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link. I have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn’t process it) is very unfair. Kindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written, whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the project with little knowledge. I hope you would look into my plight, and take necessary measures. Thanks and Regards I haven’t received any mails regarding the tds project 1 please look into my concern @carlton @Jivraj @s.anand Sir please consider a re-evaluation for me, please :’) Please consider my situation a peer whos results were exactly same as mine has received 9, then how could I get 1 . 23f1002630 this is my role number please reconsider @carlton @Jivraj Few Students including me have not received any mails regarding TDS Project 1. We don’t even know what went wrong or why we didn’t received. Initially I thought that it can be due to some sending error and i will receive little late but even after 14hrs we have not received anything from the team. How are we supposed to check log and see our mistakes when we didn’t even received marks and logs. I request to check into it and provide us our marks and logs. Thank You. @carlton @Jivraj @s.anand I had built the project well on my Mac OS machine. I am very disappointed with the scores. How do i make amends for revaluation as I feel the code ran well for all tasks on my machine. Please give written steps for revaluation. Its saying that my evaluation log file is missing, i submitted everything properly. It also says no module named TasksA is found while i got 9/10 marks in the tasksA evaluation script. Kindly look into this, i worked really harrd for this project, @carlton @Jivraj @22f3000935 Page Not Found | Docker Hub you submitted this docker url through form response for project1, this repo doesn’t exists on docker. @Jivraj sir please tell me whats the issue am very confused and worried We are aware about such mistakes and we are looking into it. We will reevaluate those images. If evaluation file is missing for anyone, we will reevaluate it once more and send same through email. Can you fill form for architecture detection. Also please , kindly share evaluation log file after execution I did upload all the necessary files but it stil says tasksA is missing, and i am getting zero marks.

I have also attached my Docker log file for reference Docker image I realized that I made a mistake in my project by forgetting to uncomment a single line of code: os.path.join(os.getcwd(), “path_given”). I feel really bad about this oversight, especially after working so hard on the project and formatting everything carefully. It was an honest mistake, and I take full responsibility for it. I sincerely request you to consider re-evaluating my work, as I believe it reflects the effort and dedication I put into it.

Hello, My log file shows a “file not found” or “directory not found” error. Could you confirm whether datagen.py was executed inside the Docker container or on the host OS? If it ran on the host, I don’t see any mounting process for the /data folder into the container.

I am getting this error. @Jivraj @carlton sir, I have fixed my docker image issue that was causing the error. Please re-pull my docker image so that I can get score. Please consider me for re-evaluation. All the codes were correct, only issue was a glitch in the docker image. Hello Sir, I am facing the same issue. Please look into it. Before submission, I ran my Docker file with the evaluation script to ensure it was working, and it worked fine. Kindly help me out. My roll number is 23F3004321. Yes, something like that, My log file shows when script tries to access file it says file not found or directory not found.

I think my docker file is not evaluated properly. Kindly do check this and help me out. My reg no 24f1002633. @carlton My docker logs shows that OSError: Cannot find resource error occurred when the data generation script tried to access font files in generation for a8. image1485×807 37.4 KB The datagen.py script looked for Arial font in the try block and when it encountered error it went to the except block to use DejaVuSans, the Pillow default, except it encountered the same error there, which was not handled. Thus, datagen.py stopped abruptly without creating files for A9 and A10 as well. So effectively, my A9 and A10 did not get evaluated properly as it did not have the required files due to error during data generation for A8. Can you please re-evaluate by enclosing each of the data generation function calls in their own try-except blocks? image302×252 3.45 KB I think it would be better to enclose each of these function calls in their own try-except blocks. This screenshot is taken from the datagen.py file sent in yesterday’s results mail. So, will it be possible to re-evaluate my task A1, A8, A9 and A10? At least A9 and A10 did not even get the files to work on as they weren’t even created due to insufficient error handling in datagen.py . Also, can you help me to identify the cause of even the Pillow default font not being available? I don’t understand how a font not being available could be caused by my code. Thank you image1505×276 16.1 KB this is a 429 from sanand which is an error from your side. The evaluation already so delayed now has such issues because of which I am getting 1/20. @carlton @Jivraj does that mean our script is not evaluated? Hi @Vihaanv07 This was a good spot, we will rerun all the images where string Agent Errro: 429 Client Error.... is present. Thanks and kind regards Hi @Jayeshbansal There were 12 emails for which we didn’t rerun, we will be fair with grading you and will take care of it. Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 7.53.20 PM1440×900 13.2 KB My docker image id is different than the one I submitted “This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: 10f11a0e0cd6” @carlton @Jivraj @s.anand plz check this Hi @23F300327 This is what you submitted to us in the gform. 23f3003027@ds.study.iitm.ac.in mishkat02/automation-agent:latest We will only evaluate this image. Kind regards @carlton then why is the image id different? in the docker hub as well as my local terminal the image id is 07b16dc68225 When we build it after pulling it, it will get a unique identifier that makes sure we will only ever evaluate exactly that version. We pull it from your submission in the form. In other words, if any changes occur to the docker repo, our id will no longer match a newer version of the file. This way we can make sure we are evaluating the right version every time. Your id does not have to match ours. But we can detect changes made to the docker repo through our image id. I hope that is clear. We will do some extra sanity checks before the 1/4/2025 just incase there are any issues. But thanks for asking the question. Kind regards @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini My logs show, ‘exec format error’ and it is due to architecture issue, image was built on mac. I have updated the google form regarding the architecture. Please rerun my image. Thanks Jivraj: Docker Image Architecture Issue Report If your Docker image was run on the wrong architecture, please fill out this form: Submit Report Just fill the google form, we are rerunning such images. Greetings, Sir, I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well. To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe. I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again. Thank you for your assistance! Hi @carlton, I checked my Docker log file now and realised I missed to push a couple of files to the image. Is there anything I could do now? I have all the required files in my Git repo though. Please help. Sir in my logs it is showing that there’s cv2 module missing i mightve missed adding that in the requirements. Is there anything you could do to help me please? I am also facing the same issue. I tried evaluating the scripts with the evaluation file also. Please rerun and let me know. My Roll No is 21F1002866. Hi, For Tasks A8, A9 & A10, I am not seeing any errors in my Docker execution logs. I am assuming the evaluation script failed to fetch the output file to verify the output for some reason. Can you please try rerunning these three tasks again? These tasks are working fine for me. For Task B1. “Data outside /data is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it.” - So when the evaluation asked to write something to /tmp/hello.txt it has correctly thrown an error saying access denied. I think this should be marked as correct. As the task description itself says so, the return is passed as 200 OK ERROR:main:Error executing write_file: Access denied: /tmp/hello.txt INFO: 172.17.0.1:60918 - \"POST /run?task=Write+%27Hello+World%27+to+%60%2Ftmp%2Fhello.txt%60 HTTP/1.1\" 200 OK Similarly for task B2. INFO:main:Checking file path: /data/format.md ERROR:main:Error executing file_folder_deletion: Deletion not allowed: /data/format.md INFO: 172.17.0.1:59446 - \"POST /run?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md HTTP/1.1\" 200 OK For Task B4, if branch is not given we are assuming it as ‘main’ branch. Is it not correct? We would have at least expected the branch passed in the request. For Task B8, I could not see the task description sent in the request in evaluation log file. Can you please check if the task request was passed properly? Because I see only “=4 B8 failed: not all arguments converted during string formatting” for Task B8 @Jivraj @carlton Thanks for your encouragement.. tried debugging the issue of image not starting up in the orchestrator script.. I found that the issue was happening because of the http and https proxies being set in docker build ARG http_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.<xxx>.com:80 ARG https_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.<xxx>.com:80 ENV http_proxy=${http_proxy} ENV https_proxy=${https_proxy} This was required as my office environment was behind the proxy and it was required for uv to download the dependencies on startup.. So this had caused the image to run in my office environment and not in orchestrator environment.. now removed the same and tested in a different vm altogether and noticed that the container started up without issues.. Checkin url: Update Dockerfile removed hard coded proxies · rsjay1976/TDS-Project1-Jan25@a71e3a8 · GitHub Have pushed the latet image (rsjay1976/tds-project1-jan25:latests) to docker hub as well.. didnt make any source changes or any other changes in the image..

Thanks for your quick response sir. I just wanted to clarify that my dockerfile was recognized by Docker, and my image was successfully built, so it seems that Docker itself didn’t have an issue with the filename. However, I understand that the evaluation script might be case-sensitive and specifically looking for “Dockerfile” with an uppercase “D”. If that’s the issue, should I rename and push the file again to the repo sir. Please let me know if that’s the right fix or if I need to do anything else sir. The image id varies depending on the system it was built on. When we build it on our Xeon cloud compute it will get a different image id from yours (unless you have a Xeon system). What is common is the dcoker hub image name and tag we used. We used the one you submitted on your form. But the image id serves the same purpose. If you alter the dockerhub image, our image will no longer match the one from dockerhub. the image id sha will change. So do not worry about whether your sha matches our sha. It just acts as a way for us to make sure that we are consistently looking at the same image.

Which one is true? 10001125081080×1716 242 KB Can someone from TA team reply to this? can somebody tell me how the dockerfile not running in 5 mins is my fault? i had the same requirements.txt as many other people and their file ran in given time while mine did not. what was the need for this, sorry for my harsh words but i’m frustrated, stupid rule? For your case there was problem with our script that, we have correct, and your submission have dockerfile, license and repo exisits as well, it will be evaluated. image522×190 5.51 KB my dockerfile is available in github, Please look into the issue Thank you @Jivraj I also have same issue, can you check this… Repo link 10004311361079×2087 175 KB @carlton @Jivraj My P1 submission successfully passed all the basic sanity checks on February 15th and obtained a satisfactory score in the P1 evaluation, which was disclosed on March 29th. However, I received a communication today, April 1, stating that my Docker image is not present or public on DockerHub. I kindly request the TDS course team to investigate this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution for students encountering similar issues. This situation is particularly disheartening—seeing days of effort and dedication to Project 1 reduced to nothing, especially given the already demanding pace of the course. I will appreciate your prompt attention to this matter. Kind regards I understand the problem. It may be possible that the image id i gave may be different as i had multiple dockerfile and there is a possibility that i gave the wrong image id due to some confusion. Is it possible for reevaluation. I have worked very hard and I don’t want to lose my marks because of some wrong id misconfusion. I request to check my dockerfile once again and provide the marks accordingly dear @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Dear Sirs, I have seen that many others have posted similar issues to mine, and you have responded to some of them. To seek your attention, I am replying to this thread. Please consider my request as well, as I do not want to lose marks on a project I have worked hard on, while also helping others. I am expecting a timely and positive response from your end. Thank you. Dear Sir, I hope you’re doing well. I haven’t received any email regarding the results of Project 1. Could you please check if my result was sent or if there’s any update on this? I would really appreciate your confirmation. Mail id - 23f2000798@ds.study.iitm.ac.in @carlton Respected Sir, I have submitted my project following all the guidelines and fulfilling all the prerequisites.

Your submission will be evaluated. We won’t be considering changes after deadline, our script looks for commits before deadline and fetches latest commits before deadline.

Since my Docker image was built and recognized, I didn’t realize this would prevent evaluation. I worked hard on this project sir, and my Docker image was built successfully. Please consider my submission sir. I have been trying to resolve all the errors but just noticed that my docker image id associated with the project is “c9dc7fbcf405” , meanwhile the mail I received mentions that some other image id was evaluated. Can you please look into this matter and evaluate the correct Image ID. Roll number: 23F1001012 @carlton @Jivraj @Jivraj @Carlton I completely understand that changes to the Docker image after the deadline cannot be accepted. However, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29. image1272×395 25.7 KB But here’s the catch:** Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project 2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:* Implementing a ReAct-based workflow planning & orchestration agent, inspired by the paper ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models. Implementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc. Enhancing Shell-use & Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1. This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything. Adding useful API endpoints, including an /api/ multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing /read and /run endpoints from Project 1, plus a /clear endpoint to reset the agent’s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated. Deploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP, utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI’s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up. All this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent—it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I’m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents, and it would do that for you—without ever declining the request. I like to think of it as a terminal version of OpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent. Given all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it’s incredibly discouraging to see my project naturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates) and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate. To clarify, all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29, after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out. Furthermore, we were never informed that a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it. My only request is that if my updated P1 submission cannot be evaluated due to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my original P1 eval score could be reinstated instead of receiving a 0—since it was already evaluated and graded. Would highly appreciate your prompt support in this regard @carlton @Jivraj pro 1720×1600 81.5 KB Actually I got the email as my docker file is not in root git hub repository. But everything thing looks fine and my docker file also runs well.. I want to check my repo again ..sir kindly do my my evaluation again and we have put lot of efforts doing this project 1 . Hope the team evaluated and gives the deserved marks @carlton @ TDS TEAM There is no Dockerfile in the root directory of your GitHub repository. The standard naming convention for a Dockerfile is Dockerfile. @carlton @Jivraj please let know if any issues in my end on the docker image not present issue.. As explained in earlier thread , the only reason docker image had to be pushed was the removal my office proxies in the docker image which was making the container not to startup from orchestration environment.. any help is appreciated.. @Jivraj @carlton I updated google form 4 days ago on the architecture, Could you let me know when it will be re-evaluated ? Thanks Hi @thinkmachine @22f3002723 Since you updated docker repo few days ago and docker api doens’t support timestamp based pulling we will pull your GitHub repo before 18 th feb and will build through it and run evaluations. We also have your docker repo evaluation score, will discuss which one to keep. This is for anyone who updated their docker repo and there are around 10-20 such cases Thanks for the understanding @Jivraj Hi @thinkmachine As we said before that changes in Docker image after deadline won’t be accepted. Even an extension of the deadline won’t help in this case, simply because Docker API doesn’t support timestamp based pulling. However we would be pulling your GitHub repositories before 18th Feb build a Docker container and run evaluations on that. @Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini request your help in clarification for the same, the Github repo has been always present but it is marking it as fail. Thank you A sigh of relief! Thank you so much for the heads up @Jivraj. @Saransh_Saini Yup! The Docker issue is perfectly understandable. Even I checked my Hub repo, and I couldn’t seem to find an image having the pre-18th Feb digest. Had I been aware of this issue, and the fact that a re-eval would be carried out, I would’ve tagged the updated image differently. Hopefully, cases like mine will aid in resolving any issues in the future. Once again, thank you both! @Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini I am still uncertain as to why I received a second email regarding my project 1 score, indicating a failure due to unmet pre-requisites. I have inquired multiple times, yet I have not received a response. Meanwhile, several other posts, both before and after mine, have been addressed. Kindly clarify about that mail. Thankyou @carlton Sir pls see my issue I have the same issue. I also received a second mail stating I had failed due to some missing prerequisites though in the first mail my project evaluation had been carried out. Hi @lakshaygarg654 Dont worry you passed pre-requsites. The script that was used earlier for basic checks used a stricter criteria, the newer one we wrote allowed for a looser check. You have scored very well in your latest run. 12 correct tasks. We have not responded quickly because we are in the midst of finalising all the scores and doing normalisation etc, i.e operational work for Project 1 and 2. We hope to have Project 2 scores out by this weekend. Kind regards @carlton @Jivraj Sir can you also see the case of Dockerfile name. Many students have named it dockerfile , lower case ‘d’ character instead of upper case. Please sir see through it Thanks @carlton , for your response. I was never worried about the result, whether it comes late or early. I know you will release it once everything is processed correctly. My concern was only about getting a response. Anyway, thanks for replying. Also, today’s session has been canceled. I wanted to ask about the issue with editing responses in the Project 2 form. Is there any update on this? Hi just wanted to know, there was no mail prior stating to keep the Dockerfile in the root folder of the repo (correct me if im wrong). Therefore i have put everything inside a folder - wont this be considered? Please clarify if possible.

Hi @AryanTikam I looked at your github repo, You have used python’s openai module for doing project1, but AIPROXY_TOKEN is supposed to be used through anand sir’s proxy. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Can you pls tell me my project 1 marks My evaluation.py had 2 score First one 1/20 where every task showed error second one had 10/20… Dockerfile has to be insider root directory of github repo. This was mistake from our end we rectified it and reevaluated your submission. Your submission has a good score. swati-iitm/project1_final This is your github repo which doesn’t have a Dockerfile. That’s why It didn’t pass Prechecks We have reevaluated it, we have scores avaliable for your submission. Sir I understand you will be busy evaluating all the files and reevaluating them as well. I just wanted to know if its a confirm 0 for those who got evaluation log file MISSING and didnt get the other mail that many got in the past 2 days… Just to confirm… cause i think am getting 0 from that @carlton @Jivraj So can anything be done about it now as it seems to pass more tasks without the proxy requirement? It is fine if not. Please, can you put a screenshot of where it has been communicated, prior to the deadline. We have communicated it in the live sessions. It was also communicated via an email when students failed first prerequisite check pass back in February 16th. At that time we gave students a time window to fix it. We discussed it internally with @s.anand and he stated that it is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github and he expects students to do it regardless of whether we explicitly mentioned it or not on the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise. In our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by @s.anand So unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image. Kind regards, TDS team @carlton Sir, I would like to respectfully ask if this is some sort of April Fool’s joke, as it appears that the TDS team is still only verifying the presence of files in the git repository and checking the accessibility of the repository. I fully understand the importance of marks and the effort we put into Project 1. That’s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0 Score. I am not the only one facing this issue; several others have encountered the same problem. I kindly request you to review my submission again. Additionally, I have faced multiple technical issues in recent times. Initially, I was failed in the L1 viva due to a typing mistake, which was later acknowledged. Similarly, in both OPPE 1 and OPPE 2, many students experienced Google Meet issues. On March 29, during my SC OPPE, I faced camera issues in Google Meet, along with VM lagging. Many students have raised similar concerns with Proctor. Given this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation. I sincerely request you to re-evaluate my submission.

The email was sent by a script that used a more stricter evaluation (which understandably caused some stress). So you can breathe a sigh of relief. However with regards to your long post… Let me tell you a true story. I personally know a very experienced senior engineer at a top defense contractor for the US, here is some pearls of wisdom from him. What you have done is what is called in industry as gold plating. Its a cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec. In fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why? Because it does not deliver what was required, Wastes valuable time and resources Increases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!) Complicates testing Leads to scope creep His advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate. I hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out. For personal hobbies this does not apply. But for a client (including us) if you fail to deliver the minimum spec then we cannot grant you an evaluation (by the way this post is not targetted specifically for you, it just felt like an appropriate place to explain this). Kindest regards Hi Sir, I just realized that I mistakenly submitted the image tag “abhay227/version1” instead of the correct image ID. The correct image ID is 4db729a03f74 , which is part of version1 that is already present and publicly available. I have worked very hard on this project, and I am concerned that due to this error, my whole effort may be wasted. Unfortunately, I did not receive any notification regarding an invalid submission after I submitted the Project1 form, and I only recently became aware of this mistake. I kindly request you please consider this correct image ID. Thank you for your understanding and assistance. I look forward to your positive response. @carlton @Jivraj Screenshot 2025-04-02 1322141843×250 18.1 KB Hi Abhay, This was a basic error. Unfortunately for basic errors we are not able to relax the requirements. All students were given a clear directive on what the minimum requirements were in order to be evaluated. Failure to follow those clear instructions prevents us from making any exceptions, because then we just have to dump all those requirements for all students and that would not be fair to those that took the care to be careful about their submissions. Kind regards Hi sir, hope you are doing well. Could you please check and let me know if I have passed the project 1 and if yes then how much am I scoring in Project 1 after the latest evaluation? @carlton Thanks for the clarification regarding the evaluation, @carlton. It’s a relief to know that my original submission was successfully evaluated. Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April 1), I would’ve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether. Regarding your point on gold plating — I completely understand and have come to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience, especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets, maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS projects, my goal was purely exploratory — to explore the boundaries of what’s possible within the scope of the problem statement. What began as just another (pun intended) tedious assignment slowly evolved into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents. (…caution: long post ahead ) I noticed that test cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python & Shell use. While it would’ve been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the inherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads. No two payloads are exactly alike — even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably. There’s also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM. Some might suggest using temperature=0 to get more deterministic LLM behavior — and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn’t be helpful here as 4o-mini isn’t all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions. There’s only so much stuff it can pay attention to. Hardcoded tool agents also aren’t really “agents” in my view— they’re more like passive AI powered regex matchers: merely mapping inputs to functions by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning process. If they break, the agent will never try to ‘fix’ them and keep calling them like a broken record. At the core of it, it’s all about how much flexibility vs rigidity we give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between — The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio. Since most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to, Reason about the task, understand intent, Reflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e. design a DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else) Execute those workflows (walk the DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed. Observe the final result, and repeat if needed. Interestingly, a similar framework was suggested in this ICLR 2022 paper. That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction. To make environment interaction possible, the agent didn’t need dozens of narrow tools — just a small, well-defined set of general-purpose tools: A REPL executor (for quick calcs) A Python script runner A Shell executor With just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally — avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more. As for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of Project 1 (like training & tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results etc.) — that was emergent behavior, not deliberate gold plating. It was a pleasant surprise even to me. I’ve yet to discover more of such interesting hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research. Frankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff! I am actually very thankful to the TDS course team & @s.anand for devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with. Food for thought! Really! As for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I’ll be experimenting with— modalities. PS: I’m not claiming it’s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects: thoughtful use of LLMs in agent design. At this point, I’m less concerned about the marks, I’m actually enjoying the thought joyride. TL;DR My approach doesn’t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates — much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I’ve only just wired the pieces together.

I had included the Dockerfile as required. I also added the MIT License to the project. For your reference, I am also attaching a snapshot of the repository as it was during the submission time. Given all these were in place, I would really appreciate it if you could provide a concrete reason for giving zero marks.

Hi sir I noticed a discrepancy in my Project 1 results. In the initial results shared on March 29th, I had received 8/20 based on the evaluation logs. However, the final result I received today states that none of the tasks in Task A and B were working, and I was awarded only 1 bonus mark. During my own testing, I was consistently getting 7/10 correct in Task A, so I’m a bit confused about the change. Kindly request you to look into this discrepancy sir Thank you Dear @carlton Sir, I was getting 8 marks in your evaluation but today I checked the mail, I was awarded 0 marks. I am not sure what happened. Everything was in place. I would really appreciate if you can provide a reason for zero marks. I rechecked everything and looks good. Awaiting your reply. Thanks. image452×132 6.53 KB same i also got 8 marks but today in mail i got 0 marks Same issue for me, I was getting 10/20 earlier and now, in mail it shows 1. Same issue for me, i had got 4/20 before but in the mail, my marks is given as 0. Please help Respected sir, I have passed all pre-requisites however my file wasn’t evaluated due to port error (127.0.0.1). Please allow me rectify it as it everything else has passed and is in accordance to the guidelines and I had worked really hard for it not to be evaluated only. Dear @carlton Sir, I’ve noticed discrepancies in my Project 1 results. During the tests I ran before submitting, I consistently got about 7/10 in Task A. In the results shared earlier, I was informed that my evaluation log file was missing. Later, a Gform regarding the architecture was sent, which I filled and submitted. Now, the final result I received today, shows that the taskA module is missing and I’ve been given a bonus of 1 mark. I kindly request you to look into the matter and provide an explanation and solution in this regard. Thank you. Respected Sir, I hope you’re all doing well. I’m writing regarding my Project 1 evaluation, as I’ve encountered a discrepancy that I’d like some help with. According to the evaluation email I received, my score was 0 for all the tasks with an additional bonus of 1 (totaling a P1 score of 1). However, when I ran the provided evaluation script before my submission, I got 7 in Phase A. Additionally, after reviewing the Docker logs, evaluation logs, and the p1_evaluation_error_logs (from the linked Google Sheets), I couldn’t find any reference to my roll number. Could someone please help me investigate this issue? I’d really appreciate any guidance from the evaluation team. Thank you for your time and assistance! @carlton i am sure i had cleared 8/10 test cases in part A of the project despite rigrous checking and no error was found my be but still i have been alloted 0 in all the cases , this is no small issue as project holds a significant amount of weightage in the end term I had spent hours finishing my project and this i am sure my marks are not on par with the desired work i did Look into this matter as it signifies if i will be able yo pass tds in this term or not.

Could you rerun the test ? Respected Sir, Thank you for your response and for providing the steps to replicate the test environment. Steps Taken to Replicate the Test Environment I cloned my repository using: bash git clone <my_repo_url> cd <my_repo_directory> I built the Docker image using: bash docker build -t. I ran the Docker container with: bash docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 I ensured that datagen.py and evaluate.py were placed in the same folder as instructed. Finally, I ran the evaluation script using: bash uvicorn evaluate.py --email=<any_email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000 Issue with Original Submission After reviewing the evaluation logs, I identified that the issue with my original submission was caused by binary incompatibility between pandas (version 2.0.3) and NumPy (version 1.24.3). These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally. However, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail. I acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message. Action Taken To address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected: The application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes. It responds to requests within the required timeframe. I have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository: Docker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest Request for Re-Evaluation I kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly. Previous Message for Reference For your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail: \"Greetings, Sir, I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well. To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe. I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again. Thank you for your assistance!\" same for me my roll number is 23f1003094 Same with me sir @carlton There are no evaluation logs for you, I am not sure which evaluation log you are referring to. Your docker image fails to run the required task because your Dockerfile is misconfigured. Did you follow the test environment setup mentioned in this post before posting your query?

You must replicate the test environment and then if you submission works, you have a legitimate appeal. Otherwise we will not consider it. Please replicate the issue using the test environment as detailed in the post link. Kind regards You can take it up with @s.anand I did not come up with the standard. And it is a standard practise to have build configurations at root of a project otherwise no one will know where to search for the configuration files. Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in.

Did you try to replicate the test environment as mentioned in Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science To replicate the test environment: Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that import requests import pandas DEADLINE = pd.Timestamp(\"2025-02-18\", tz=\"Asia/Kolkata\") url = f\"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits\" try : response = requests.get(url,headers=github_headers, timeout=60) fetch_commit = None if response.status_code == 200: commits = response.json() for commit in commits: sha = commit[\"sha\"] … If you tried you would find that it will not build. Thats why you have no logs. 90 such cases are there where the image could not be built from your repo. The specific error in your case is: tried copying requirements.txt which doesn’t exists Thats why there are no logs. Kind regards Hello @carlton Sir, please reply to my query We cannot allow changes to repos. This is a blanket rule for everyone. No exceptions. Since the only way to get your project to work is to make changes to it, we cannot score you for changes. Kind regards Thanks for the response. We can go on endless discussions using “nice words” “professionally” with the number of questions we have. Finally we are at the receiving end as students in this setup. What’s the take away for everyone? Let’s move on. This isn’t the end. Positive or Negative - Real world outside will make everyone realise and everyone change their opinions (including me) as the time and environment changes. What I observed is that most of the repositories appear to be copied from a single source. This original repository contains several issues, such as an incorrectly named Dockerfile and missing instructions to copy all necessary data. Unfortunately, many students seem to have uploaded it blindly without reviewing or fixing these problems. Hi I have my Dockerfile saved as dockerfile, given 0 for project 1 due to this. This doesn’t seem to be a big issue to grade me 0 for this. Kindly correct the score please. Most common reason for during running docker image was taskA module was missing which is because a lot of students blindly copied from someone with building and running image, if they would have done that they could have corrected it at early stage. For you check failed because of the naming of Dockerfile(It was named as dockerfile(d in small). This is error that you got while building docker image using docker file in your github repo tried copying requirements.txt which doesn’t exists In your Dockerfile you are trying to copy requirements.txt but it doesn’t exists in the directory where Dockerfile is located MITALI_R: 23f1003094 While running docker image create by your github repo, we got following error taskA module missing For regenerating it follow steps that are mentioned here : Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies - #316 For you naming of MIT License was not correct. This shows naming criteria for adding License. Adding a license to a repository - GitHub Docs Sir actually my project doesn’t have requirements.txt, instead it installs automatically when: uv run app.py is run and for docker image it installs while building and I had submitted the docker image with all libraries required(the dockerfile below, in that it installs while building). my dockerfile from the repo: FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm # Install dependencies RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates # Download and install uv ADD https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh /uv-installer.sh RUN sh /uv-installer.sh && rm /uv-installer.sh # Install FastAPI and Uvicorn RUN pip install fastapi uvicorn requests python-dateutil pandas db-sqlite3 scipy pybase64 python-dotenv httpx markdown duckdb faker pillow # Ensure the installed binary is on the `PATH` ENV PATH=\"/root/.local/bin:$PATH\" # Set up the application directory WORKDIR /app # Copy application files COPY *.py /app/ COPY .env /app/ # Explicitly set the correct binary path and use `sh -c` CMD [\"/root/.local/bin/uv\", \"run\", \"app.py\"] here u can see it installs using pip install … here it’s requiring .env file to be present in the project folder because my project when I was uploading to both git and docker had .env file for AIPROXY_TOKEN and I uploaded to docker with that .env file but as git doesn’t allow upload of .env file I couldn’t upload.env to git the project will still work after downloading the repository when we upload AIPROXY_TOKEN as environment variable but to again build the docker image for replicating the test environment, my docker image could not be built because.env file doesn’t upload to GIT, so when I downloaded the repository from the above method, it didn’t have the .env file so it didn’t build so I had to create the .env file now to create the docker image, and for the dockerimage I had submitted, I built it with the .env file(it supports both.env file and environment variable one) After filling form you didn’t double check form. Abhay222: I kindly request you please consider this correct image ID. We can’t reconsider it. Yes problem was missing .env file, Your repo, was supposed to run in a test environment. Yes sir, please help me Sorry We can’t do any help, we won’t be considering for eval. But sir, It was supposed to run right… It Should build in any test environment using Dockerfile from your github repo. @Jivraj please tell me what was my mistake? It was named wrongly. You named it LICENCE but it should be LICENSE or LICENSE.md. But sir, just because the repository doesn’t have .env file it couldn’t build the dockerimage, the docker image will build in any test environment as u said but it requires the .env to be included which the git didn’t have(it doesn’t allow upload of it ofcourse), don’t rerun the evaluation again but please sir atleast give me those 7/20 marks along with the pre-requisite bonus(1mark) that was mailed earlier to me along with logs…this is my primary degree after 12th, I’m also not asking any extra marks just the marks that i got earlier: image1850×1021 132 KB Hi @23f2002600 @21f1005908 Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science You can take it up with @s.anand I did not come up with the standard.

In your github repo, Dockerfile should be named as Dockerfile(D caps). I don’t know reason behind it, earlier evaluation was done by pulling docker image. Latest one was done through github repo, if code in github repo is not consistent with docker image it might cause problems. LLM won’t provide same results every time, for that reason we have give bonus marks. @carlton @jivraj sir it is my humble request to do something. We are losing our marks because of small negligence or mistakes like i fogot to commit my requirements.txt in my github repository. Already the course has taken tolls on our mind. Please give partial marks for the correct run of the docker image or please evaluate my latest commit with the requirements.txt. Because of this project I will lose my cgpa and the hardwork that I have done till this term. A small mistake is causing me my full marks and grades. Atleast consider partial marking for the docker image which does the tasks. I have maintained 9+ cgpa in the diploma and I took other subjects which are easy this term like BDM still is really difficult to cope with the subject. Please consider something. atleast give 50% of the marks for each task which my image passes. Sir but i did test my project via evaluate.py and got the 8/10 in my tasks A. A simple port error has resulted in no evaluation at all after all the hardwork. Sir, how my git repo is not consistent i used the same repo which i have given you in the form even i did not commit any changes after 18th feb also in my docker file there is just a simple mistake that i forgot to add flask dependency just because of that mistake i am losing my marks. I also used same docker image which i have given you through form. Its my humble request please consider or give some solution. It felt like betrayal because we put effort’s. Dear Sir, I understand that this request is coming at a late stage, and I truly apologize for the timing. However, I felt it was important to express how much effort and dedication I have invested in this project and throughout the course. The recent issue has been disheartening for me, especially because the work I submitted was not a blind copy from someone else. Had it been otherwise, I wouldn’t have had the courage to reach out. I genuinely care about this course and the learning it offers, and I’m proud of the commitment I’ve shown so far. With utmost respect, I kindly request you to reconsider evaluating my project again, if there’s any possible way to do so. It would mean a lot to me and would really motivate me to keep pushing forward in this subject. Hi @23f1001524 @afsalshah @23f1000879 @23f1002056 I understand your situation. We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then it would make evaluations meaningless. We are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure. A minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working. Critical failures prevents everything else from working and thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact critical failures. I know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be important going forward in your career. Kindest regards Hi @carlton , I couldn’t find my Docker logs or evaluation logs in the latest result mail, even though I had passed the prerequisites.

Thanks for the fixes (I have updated the code now). It was put together quickly and not tested before we actually posted it. Happy to help sir (Was expecting some different response from your side,but ig we need to accept our faith ) Thank you, (Kindest regards) Tushar We are checking you submission. We will get in touch shortly. @carlton @jivraj @s.anand, I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to humbly request a reconsideration regarding the evaluation of my project submission. I understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I’m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn’t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night. I do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students—including myself—it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation. I sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I’ve worked hard to demonstrate. I know you all have our best interests in mind, and I’m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties—especially for a single oversight—can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can be considered with empathy. Thank you for your time and understanding. Issues with your submission has been resolved. Thanks for raising the issue and checking it at your end. Sir, I sincerely apologize for the mistake I made in naming the LICENSE file as “LIcense” instead of “LICENSE”. I now understand how important these details are, and it was an unintentional oversight on my part. I had put in a lot of hard work into the project, and it would mean a lot to me if you could kindly consider evaluating it, even though the deadline has passed and results are out. I completely understand if it’s not possible, but I just wanted to request a chance as this project was very important to me and I genuinely learned a lot from it. @Jivraj @carlton image1188×699 38.6 KB cloned the repository using git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/llmagent.git image1041×721 29.2 KB created the .env for the aiproxy token as its needed to build the docker image as per my Dockerfile and .env file cannot be uploaded to git we have to create it while building docker image evalue752×994 45.3 KB added the new evaluate.py and datagen.py from the mail, trying to replicate the test environment image730×462 21.4 KB moved the new datagen.py and evaluate.py into the project folder image1805×989 79.9 KB docker image built successfully using docker build -t llm-agent . image1694×974 55.5 KB running the evaluate.py using: uv run evaluate.py --email=23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000 image1385×971 46.9 KB got consistent 6/25 after even running the file 6 times @carlton @Jivraj @s.anand Please sir check this, just because my docker image needs .env, I cannot get full 0…I need to maintain my cgpa (by getting 0 in project my grade is going too close to E grade sir and already in D, already my ROE got bad due to technical issues which on the same day around 6pm after finding way to unlock the input of answers for roe I completed the roe again in short amount of time like 10 or 20 minutes and got 10/10 but still it was rejected because it was late, max 3 minutes after 1:45PM was allowed…I’m not asking to any extra marks, just my marks) I’m trying to improve it already I have 4 subjects in a single term, please give me atleast this marks with the bonus 1 mark for prerequisites (total 7) image704×248 20 KB Thank you Yes,the Same case happend to me also we have put lot of efforts in this project but after seeing that in mail you have no mit licence, I added that license but with name of mit license actually to just name that license file as MIT license but due to this all our hardwork is just an experience but actually we are not awarding any marks in project1 .

I have reviewed the logs, and it indicates that the /app/app/main.py file is missing. However, in my project directory, the main.py file is located in the app/ folder, and the run.py file is in the root folder of the project, which is LLM_Automation_Agent . This structure allows the run.py file to run the project without any issues by calling the appropriate functions from app/main.py. To run the project, the command I used is: python run.py Since run.py is placed in the root folder and not in any subfolder, it should properly execute the project without any errors, as it redirects the calls to app/main.py. I believe the evaluation may have been incorrect because the project was not executed in the way it was intended. I kindly request you to re-run the project using the run.py script located in the root folder (llm-automation-agent). For your reference, I have attached screenshots from my local machine where the project was tested successfully, along with my GitHub screenshot.

Thank You @Jivraj for showing me. Question: Now that I know. how can I test the container myself, if I want to do exactly what you guys are doing? My code uses npx to format Markdown files using Prettier, specifically via subprocess.run([\"npx\", \"prettier@3.4.2\", \"--write\", ...]), which assumes that npx is available in the environment. However, since the Docker container is based on Linux and I didn’t explicitly install Node.js or npx, this results in an error during evaluation. To test the functionality correctly, npx must be installed inside the running container. This can be fixed by entering the container and installing Node.js and npm using: bash: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm Once installed, npx prettier@3.4.2 should work as expected. For reference, this approach worked perfectly when I tested the same task locally on my Windows 11 system, where npx is available by default. @Jivraj @carlton Before the project evaluation, I ran the test script and successfully passed all Task A and Task B checks.

At the time of submission, the image was running smoothly, was fully accessible, and was successfully handling the API calls as intended. Screenshot 2025-04-07 233513805×197 9.52 KB Github repo submitted: GitHub - wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent Docker repo submitted: wasimansariiitm/my-ai-agent The previous evaluation was successfully conducted using my Docker image, which was responding as expected. However, during the subsequent evaluation, the image was rebuilt using my GitHub repo link, and unfortunately, the app.py file could not be found. As a result, my evaluation logs are missing from the evaluation logs bundle. I would like to respectfully bring this to your kind attention that the app.py file does exist in the repository, but it is located inside a subfolder: https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/app/app.py. But as per the submission instructions, I provided the GitHub repo link only: https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent. Humbly stating, I did not anticipate that the image will be rebuilt from the GitHub repo at a later stage due to some unforeseen circumstances. Had I known this, I would have made sure the project repo was structured appropriately to support that scenario. To be noted, that the earlier evaluation ran smoothly, and the app responded to all queries as expected. I’m unsure what to expect now or request, but I just wanted to bring this issue to your notice. Even if I manage to get a single answer correct upon a successful evaluation, it would mean a lot to me and contribute meaningfully to my overall score. I would be extremely grateful if you could look into my case and extend your support in this matter.

Edit 1: I just realized that the datagen script looked for the fonts in python 3.13/site-packages/… But my docker image is using the python:3.12-slim-bookworm. Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements. Edit 2: Even if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking. image1027×510 11 KB Though an error occured in A8, A9 and A10 still could have worked if each of these function calls were enclosed in their own try-except blocks, ensuring independent checks for each task. But the current datagen.py script fails as error propagates to main, where it is not handled and causes abnormal termination without executing the functions for creating files for A9 and A10 as well. Thank you. Regards, Shivaditya Hi Haricharan Your Dockerfile does not build the repo. Its misconfigured. This is the error when building it: => ERROR [8/8] COPY .env /app/ 0.0s ------ > [8/8] COPY .env /app/: ------ Dockerfile:20 -------------------- 18 | # Copy application files 19 | COPY *.py /app/ 20 | >>> COPY .env /app/ 21 | 22 | # Explicitly set the correct binary path and use `sh -c` -------------------- ERROR: failed to solve: failed to compute cache key: failed to calculate checksum of ref 468faeeb-6d46-4aeb-a590-25bae24a84d5::y52oingx9lezoq9kjiwp6v58m: \"/.env\": not found Screenshot 2025-04-08 at 11.12.18 am754×302 41 KB This is because if you look at your Dockerfile .env does not exist in your repo.

Kind regards Hi, Please let me know the reason on why I have not got any bonus marks. image1310×681 14.5 KB image1696×732 59.5 KB We used some internal parameters with weights to auto calculate the bonus. Unless your submission met that threshold of 0.5 after scaling you would not get any bonus. Your score was normalised so instead of 3 you got 4 (3.75 got rounded up). But the metrics used to evaluate the quality of your submission only scored you at 0.007 which is far below the threshold required to get a bonus. Respected Sir, Yes Sir, I said the same, .env was not able to be uploaded to repo as .env file was not allowed to be uploaded when we download the repository it doesn’t have the .env file, for docker image to build we need to add .env with AIPROXY_TOKEN after that docker image will build, I had given about this in previous message As you said Sir that you will use separate AIPROXY_TOKEN…you can put that in .env file and build the docker image after that Sir its optional to pass AIPROXY_TOKEN again while running the docker Image just the .env file required, even without token in that it will work as project has support for both AIPROXY token in .env file and as environment variable and when I uploaded to repository the .env file was not allowed to upload so had submitted that way, I actually forgot to add step for running the docker image in the previous message, the steps which I used: git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/llmagent.git adding .env with AIPROXY token and replacing evaluate.py and datagen.py with new ones according to test environment docker build -t llm-agent . docker run -p 8000:8000 llm-agent or docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=token -p 8000:8000 llm-agent and in another terminal uv run evaluate.py --email=23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000 Thank you Kind regards Respected sir I understand it’s my mistake sir and I apologize for that sir, but please consider this time sir since because of this my entire project score went from 9/20 to 0, which would make me difficult to pass this course and continue my diploma. Please consider this request sir, sorry sir and this would never be repeated in future. My project evaluation was 9/20 initially sir, but later it came down to 0 because of this issue. Kindly consider sir please. Regards, S Sharmile 23f3001688 Thanks for relentless efforts @carlton @Jivraj I tested the docker file in docker playground again..

Thanks @carlton @Jivraj As mentioned earlier, the pre Feb 18 dockerFile commited in GIT had my office proxy url’s set as http_proxy and https_proxy.. It worked in my office envuironment and i tested everything in my office environment but based on the results which came on March last week realised that the proxies were preventing the uv to be installed in other environments. Post that realised we have cloud based \"docker playground’ utility where docker builds can be tested agonistic of any environment.. The good thing with playground is our instances last for only 3 hrs and next day we try we are kind of gauranteed of fresh environment without any caches, Now after March 30th checkin validated the same in docker playground and ensured that the image got tagged and createdd successfully.. It would be great if the March 30th checkin could be considered, Again appreciate all your help so far. Subject: Request for Verification of Dockerfile and Reevaluation of Marks for Project 1 @carlton @Jivraj Sir, Regarding the recent feedback on Project 1 for TDS, it was mentioned that there is no Dockerfile in my GitHub repo. However, the Dockerfile is named dockerfile (not Dockerfile). Please verify the repository again with this in mind. Additionally, my Docker image architecture is linux/amd64 (64-bit x86). I have also filled out the Architecture Information Collector form as requested. Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail) Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1 Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1 Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1 Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists: 0 image1914×1021 91.6 KB Here’s the link to my GitHub repository: github.com GitHub - 23f1001822/task_agent_api Contribute to 23f1001822/task_agent_api development by creating an account on GitHub. Docker repo submitted: sakshamumate/task_agent_api I kindly request a reevaluation of my project marks based on these clarifications. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please let me know if you need any further information or clarification. Best regards, Saksham Umate , 23f1001822@ds.study.iitm.ac.in Sir, I had posted the query on A8 and datagen exception. Is this a reply to that? oh yeah sorry, hit the reply to the wrong button, but yes its to your post. I’ve got good news for you and 30 other students. Thanks to your diligent debugging effort that we were able to find this bug. For now the fix is that we will not evaluate you on a8 and catch the datagen exception so as to not cause cascading failures. Thanks and kind regards. We will let you know the outcome of the evaluations soon. @carlton @Jivraj any way out for my earlier query ? @carlton Thank you for the reply .But it was working when i ran the initial evalaute.py .If you don’t mind could you tell what may have caused this to happen. Hi Hilal, You have to recreate the test environment as shown in this post Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science To replicate the test environment: Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can run this code using uv. # /// script # dependencies = [ # \"requests\", # ] # /// import requests import datetime as dt import zoneinfo import argparse import os import zipfile parser = argparse.… That way you will be able to identify why the error was occuring. The specific error itself means: Docker is trying to run the command uv inside your container, but it can’t find the uv executable — it’s not installed or not in the system PATH inside the container. If you did not run evaluate.py as specified in our live sessions by recreating the test environment and then running evaluate.py then it would not have reflected how your dockerised application would work. Kind regards sir for my project 1 i got a mail stating that the docker file isn’t public and that’s why prerequisite failed. but i checked it and it seemed absolutely perfect to me. Please look into this issue as my docker repo is public and absolutely as per the requirement. @carlton @Jivraj Hi @22f3003083 Following was your submission, which is not a valid dockerrepo. image1829×251 22 KB Now I feel so good getting 0. 0 is best. @carlton @Jivraj As requested earlier, Could you please reevaluate my submission. The only change that had to be done post Feb 18 checkin was to remove my office proxies on Mar 30 from the docker file to make it work in all environments.. It would be great if this could be accomodated.. Hi Jayaram, Unfortunately, we are not able to relax restrictions on changes to your repo, regardless of the reason. We have kept this rule uniform for everyone. If we allow this change, then everyone has a legitimate reason to request changes and would make the rule meaningless because then everyone will be able to make corrections to their submission. We do not even allow spelling changes. Kind regards Thanks for the response @carlton .. just a small suggestion, to avoid scenarios like what i faced and also with softwares like docker/podman not being too windows friendly, i think students can find it easier if a dev/mock linux env is provided for course term duration, instead of everyone having to figuring out with AWS/Azure and all providers.. Anyway thanks and appreciate all the help Sir, I have done everything for my project, but I am getting zero. I have uploaded my Docker file, but the email says it is not public. Sir, this is affecting my grades — please help me out. @Carlton These are your project 1 responses, image1737×291 23.2 KB We are considering latest submission which have docker repo maheshsingh01/tdsrepos which is not accessible publically. image1866×949 92.7 KB Sir, could you please check it once more? I think the issue has been resolved. @carlton @Jivraj Since repo was not public during evaluation, we won’t be rechecking, or reevaluating. @Jivraj I’ve completed all the required steps, but I’m still getting 0, It was working fine before. Could you please help me identify what might be going wrong? Hi @21f3003107 You need to look it up yourself, We have sent out evaluation log and docker log files, check those out. Evaluation script and other scripts that we have used are there in github repository over here. Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies - Courses / Tools in Data Science - IITM-DSA If there is some mistake from our end let us know about it. To replicate test environment follow steps provided below. Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies - Courses / Tools in Data Science - IITM-DSA @carlton Requested sir This is to request that in my evaluation a got 0 cause of the use of lowercase d instead of uppercase D but I have already submitted the docker file in my git hub repo also. WhatsApp Image 2025-04-11 at 23.34.06_a49fd1e5912×727 79.5 KB @carlton Thank you i found my mistake in my docker file i wrote this CMD [“uv”, “run”, “app.py”] instead of CMD [“uvicorn”, “main:app”, “–host”, “0.0.0.0”, “–port”, “8000”].Now i think everything works fine Sir my repo was public Sir any news on this? Did my score increase at all? My dashboard still shows the old score. @carlton sir, my project 1 marks have still not increased even though while during evaluation it shows 4/10 for the task 1. It was said that the docker image prerequisite will be removed and without that the evaluation would be done, but there is still no change in my marks. please look into it once, as my dashboard currently reflects 0 for project 1. These evals are being handled separately. They have not yet been completed. Kindly bear with us till they are complete. Same here @carlton in my evaluation logs i have scored 10 while marks being reflected are not the same neither on mail nor on site I looked at your evaluation logs and it says 1 score instead of 10. Good evening! 1000092114|690x198 I am writing to you to request you please relook into the evaluation. The docker image which I share is working at my end. The size of the image is 6 GB which may take more than 5 minutes to load as I wasn’t aware of the infra level restrictions. I request you to kindly consider my request and please re-evaluate the assignment as I have contributed a lot of effort into it. Thanks, Garima Sir, so will my score get updated because now it is marked as 0. @carlton @Jivraj Sir, I am Saksham Umate and my project 1 was to be re-evaluation because of docker file not found in root ,but it was their so you had given me confirmation that it will re-evaluate after end term. I had already shared my docker file systems configuration at docker hub So, I hope you will look at this and re-evaluate my project as I put lots of efforts to complete it Tell me if any information is needed about project from my side Thank you!

Did Mark’s are updated or being update for this students ? Hi @22f3000819 We had updated datagen.py(try block for task) which affected 30 students, but scores changed only for 4 students, for others it remained the same. We will be pushing marks today. I probably wasn’t 1 of the 4, right? Anyways thanks for paying attention to the matter. Regards, Shivaditya @carlton @Jivraj Respected Sir, I hope you are doing well. This is with reference to your confirmation mail that my project 1 will be re-evaluated after end term I would like to sincerely apologize for the oversight in my Project 1 submission. Upon reviewing my GitHub repository, I realized that the file was named dockerfile (with a lowercase ‘d’) in the Github root repo instead of the required Dockerfile (with an uppercase ‘D’). While the contents of the file were correct and my project passed several evaluation tests, I understand that the evaluation script could not detect the Dockerfile due to this naming issue. I genuinely did not intend to deviate from the standard, and I now fully understand the importance of following naming conventions precisely. I humbly request you to kindly consider this as an honest mistake and allow a one-time exception, Please sir. This issue has unfortunately resulted in my project score being reduced to 0, which puts my overall course performance at risk. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and such an error will not occur again in the future. So, I hope you will look at this and re-evaluate my project as I put lots of efforts to complete it. Thank you very much for your time and consideration. Warm regards, S. Sharmile Roll No: 23f3001688 Sir, my marks still did not get updated, please help me in that regard. Hi Everyone, We have sent the updated marks to Operations. At this time of the term they are very busy with lots of updates, so it will take time for them to push it to the dashboard. As soon as they inform us that the scores have been pushed, we will send out a discrepancy form if you find any issues with your score. Thanks & Kind regards Sir, my project 1 marks are still 0 even though I had passsd few cases. Please help me sir as my final score is coming as 69.8 , it will be very valuable for me if it crosses 70, please sir help me with this regard @carlton Hi Sir, I hope you’re doing well. I just wanted to let you know that I put a lot of effort into completing Project1, but I accidentally named the Dockerfile as dockerfile (with a lowercase ‘d’).

Thats why we need students to look through the logs and identify issues so that we can make sure you get the correct evaluation. If students notify us their image is actually arm based, then we will run it on arm. So dont worry, just inform us of any discrepancy as well as bugs. Our evaluation might not be perfect, there may be bugs. If students can precisely create bug reports then we can take that into consideration when evaluating students as well. The benefit being you might get extra marks because of the bug fix. We have a script that looks at this discourse post each day and tells us who requires a fresh evaluation. So we will check your image on arm. Kind regards",

Running on your local machine is not a sufficient criteria for passing the evaluation. It is absolutely vital for students to understand deployment. This is a critical skill for anyone who is serious about working in this field. Also just check if yours is an arm based image or x86. Sometimes that makes a difference. For us there is no way to know other than docker software telling us. As it turns out several students had an arm based image but docker did not tell us that. So we will re run those. If yours has been run on the wrong emulation then we will re run. Kind regards",

I have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday. These are the detailed point wise concerns : I at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it’s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2½ weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course. By this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn’t receive a reply. I understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them. I also didn’t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link. I have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn’t process it) is very unfair. Kindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written, whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the project with little knowledge. I hope you would look into my plight, and take necessary measures. Thanks and Regards",

Thus, datagen.py stopped abruptly without creating files for A9 and A10 as well. So effectively, my A9 and A10 did not get evaluated properly as it did not have the required files due to error during data generation for A8. Can you please re-evaluate by enclosing each of the data generation function calls in their own try-except blocks? image302×252 3.45 KB I think it would be better to enclose each of these function calls in their own try-except blocks. This screenshot is taken from the datagen.py file sent in yesterday’s results mail. So, will it be possible to re-evaluate my task A1, A8, A9 and A10? At least A9 and A10 did not even get the files to work on as they weren’t even created due to insufficient error handling in datagen.py . Also, can you help me to identify the cause of even the Pillow default font not being available? I don’t understand how a font not being available could be caused by my code. Thank you",

During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well. To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe. I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again. Thank you for your assistance!",

I am assuming the evaluation script failed to fetch the output file to verify the output for some reason. Can you please try rerunning these three tasks again? These tasks are working fine for me. For Task B1. “Data outside /data is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it.” - So when the evaluation asked to write something to /tmp/hello.txt it has correctly thrown an error saying access denied. I think this should be marked as correct. As the task description itself says so, the return is passed as 200 OK ERROR:main:Error executing write_file: Access denied: /tmp/hello.txt INFO: 172.17.0.1:60918 - \"POST /run?task=Write+%27Hello+World%27+to+%60%2Ftmp%2Fhello.txt%60 HTTP/1.1\" 200 OK Similarly for task B2. INFO:main:Checking file path: /data/format.md ERROR:main:Error executing file_folder_deletion: Deletion not allowed: /data/format.md INFO: 172.17.0.1:59446 - \"POST /run?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md HTTP/1.1\" 200 OK For Task B4, if branch is not given we are assuming it as ‘main’ branch. Is it not correct? We would have at least expected the branch passed in the request. For Task B8, I could not see the task description sent in the request in evaluation log file. Can you please check if the task request was passed properly? Because I see only “=4 B8 failed: not all arguments converted during string formatting” for Task B8",

So this had caused the image to run in my office environment and not in orchestrator environment.. now removed the same and tested in a different vm altogether and noticed that the container started up without issues.. Checkin url: Update Dockerfile removed hard coded proxies · rsjay1976/TDS-Project1-Jan25@a71e3a8 · GitHub Have pushed the latet image (rsjay1976/tds-project1-jan25:latests) to docker hub as well.. didnt make any source changes or any other changes in the image..

If you alter the dockerhub image, our image will no longer match the one from dockerhub. the image id sha will change. So do not worry about whether your sha matches our sha.

          "content": "@Jivraj @Carlton I completely understand that changes to the Docker image after the deadline cannot be accepted. However, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29. image1272×395 25.7 KB But here’s the catch:** Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project 2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:* Implementing a ReAct-based workflow planning & orchestration agent, inspired by the paper ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models. Implementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc. Enhancing Shell-use & Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1. This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything. Adding useful API endpoints, including an /api/ multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing /read and /run endpoints from Project 1, plus a /clear endpoint to reset the agent’s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated. Deploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP, utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI’s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up. All this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent—it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I’m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents, and it would do that for you—without ever declining the request. I like to think of it as a terminal version of OpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent. Given all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it’s incredibly discouraging to see my project naturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates) and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate. To clarify, all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29, after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out. Furthermore, we were never informed that a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it. My only request is that if my updated P1 submission cannot be evaluated due to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my original P1 eval score could be reinstated instead of receiving a 0—since it was already evaluated and graded. Would highly appreciate your prompt support in this regard @carlton @Jivraj",

At that time we gave students a time window to fix it. We discussed it internally with @s.anand and he stated that it is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github and he expects students to do it regardless of whether we explicitly mentioned it or not on the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise. In our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by @s.anand So unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image.

The email was sent by a script that used a more stricter evaluation (which understandably caused some stress). So you can breathe a sigh of relief. However with regards to your long post… Let me tell you a true story. I personally know a very experienced senior engineer at a top defense contractor for the US, here is some pearls of wisdom from him. What you have done is what is called in industry as gold plating. Its a cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec. In fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why? Because it does not deliver what was required, Wastes valuable time and resources Increases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!) Complicates testing Leads to scope creep His advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate. I hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out. For personal hobbies this does not apply. But for a client (including us) if you fail to deliver the minimum spec then we cannot grant you an evaluation (by the way this post is not targetted specifically for you, it just felt like an appropriate place to explain this).

          "content": "Thanks for the clarification regarding the evaluation, @carlton. It’s a relief to know that my original submission was successfully evaluated. Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April 1), I would’ve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether. Regarding your point on gold plating — I completely understand and have come to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience, especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets, maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS projects, my goal was purely exploratory — to explore the boundaries of what’s possible within the scope of the problem statement. What began as just another (pun intended) tedious assignment slowly evolved into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents. (…caution: long post ahead ) I noticed that test cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python & Shell use. While it would’ve been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the inherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads. No two payloads are exactly alike — even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably. There’s also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM. Some might suggest using temperature=0 to get more deterministic LLM behavior — and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn’t be helpful here as 4o-mini isn’t all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions. There’s only so much stuff it can pay attention to. Hardcoded tool agents also aren’t really “agents” in my view— they’re more like passive AI powered regex matchers: merely mapping inputs to functions by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning process. If they break, the agent will never try to ‘fix’ them and keep calling them like a broken record. At the core of it, it’s all about how much flexibility vs rigidity we give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between — The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio. Since most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to, Reason about the task, understand intent, Reflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e. design a DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else) Execute those workflows (walk the DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed. Observe the final result, and repeat if needed. Interestingly, a similar framework was suggested in this ICLR 2022 paper. That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction. To make environment interaction possible, the agent didn’t need dozens of narrow tools — just a small, well-defined set of general-purpose tools: A REPL executor (for quick calcs) A Python script runner A Shell executor With just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally — avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more. As for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of Project 1 (like training & tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results etc.) — that was emergent behavior, not deliberate gold plating. It was a pleasant surprise even to me. I’ve yet to discover more of such interesting hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research. Frankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff! I am actually very thankful to the TDS course team & @s.anand for devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with. Food for thought! Really! As for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I’ll be experimenting with— modalities. PS: I’m not claiming it’s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects: thoughtful use of LLMs in agent design. At this point, I’m less concerned about the marks, I’m actually enjoying the thought joyride. TL;DR My approach doesn’t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates — much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I’ve only just wired the pieces together.

Steps Taken to Replicate the Test Environment I cloned my repository using: bash git clone <my_repo_url> cd <my_repo_directory> I built the Docker image using: bash docker build -t. I ran the Docker container with: bash docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 I ensured that datagen.py and evaluate.py were placed in the same folder as instructed. Finally, I ran the evaluation script using: bash uvicorn evaluate.py --email=<any_email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000 Issue with Original Submission After reviewing the evaluation logs, I identified that the issue with my original submission was caused by binary incompatibility between pandas (version 2.0.3) and NumPy (version 1.24.3). These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally. However, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail. I acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message. Action Taken To address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected: The application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes. It responds to requests within the required timeframe. I have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository: Docker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest Request for Re-Evaluation I kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly. Previous Message for Reference For your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail: \"Greetings, Sir, I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well. To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe. I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again. Thank you for your assistance!\"",

We are losing our marks because of small negligence or mistakes like i fogot to commit my requirements.txt in my github repository. Already the course has taken tolls on our mind. Please give partial marks for the correct run of the docker image or please evaluate my latest commit with the requirements.txt. Because of this project I will lose my cgpa and the hardwork that I have done till this term. A small mistake is causing me my full marks and grades. Atleast consider partial marking for the docker image which does the tasks. I have maintained 9+ cgpa in the diploma and I took other subjects which are easy this term like BDM still is really difficult to cope with the subject. Please consider something. atleast give 50% of the marks for each task which my image passes.",

We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then it would make evaluations meaningless. We are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure. A minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working. Critical failures prevents everything else from working and thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact critical failures. I know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be important going forward in your career. Kindest regards",

I understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I’m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn’t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night. I do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students—including myself—it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation. I sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I’ve worked hard to demonstrate. I know you all have our best interests in mind, and I’m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties—especially for a single oversight—can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can be considered with empathy.

This structure allows the run.py file to run the project without any issues by calling the appropriate functions from app/main.py. To run the project, the command I used is: python run.py Since run.py is placed in the root folder and not in any subfolder, it should properly execute the project without any errors, as it redirects the calls to app/main.py. I believe the evaluation may have been incorrect because the project was not executed in the way it was intended. I kindly request you to re-run the project using the run.py script located in the root folder (llm-automation-agent).

However, since the Docker container is based on Linux and I didn’t explicitly install Node.js or npx, this results in an error during evaluation. To test the functionality correctly, npx must be installed inside the running container. This can be fixed by entering the container and installing Node.js and npm using: bash: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm Once installed, npx prettier@3.4.2 should work as expected. For reference, this approach worked perfectly when I tested the same task locally on my Windows 11 system, where npx is available by default.",

At the time of submission, the image was running smoothly, was fully accessible, and was successfully handling the API calls as intended. Screenshot 2025-04-07 233513805×197 9.52 KB Github repo submitted: GitHub - wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent Docker repo submitted: wasimansariiitm/my-ai-agent The previous evaluation was successfully conducted using my Docker image, which was responding as expected. However, during the subsequent evaluation, the image was rebuilt using my GitHub repo link, and unfortunately, the app.py file could not be found. As a result, my evaluation logs are missing from the evaluation logs bundle. I would like to respectfully bring this to your kind attention that the app.py file does exist in the repository, but it is located inside a subfolder: https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/app/app.py. But as per the submission instructions, I provided the GitHub repo link only: https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent. Humbly stating, I did not anticipate that the image will be rebuilt from the GitHub repo at a later stage due to some unforeseen circumstances. Had I known this, I would have made sure the project repo was structured appropriately to support that scenario. To be noted, that the earlier evaluation ran smoothly, and the app responded to all queries as expected. I’m unsure what to expect now or request, but I just wanted to bring this issue to your notice. Even if I manage to get a single answer correct upon a successful evaluation, it would mean a lot to me and contribute meaningfully to my overall score. I would be extremely grateful if you could look into my case and extend your support in this matter. Thank You and Regards, 24ds3000090",

Edit 1: I just realized that the datagen script looked for the fonts in python 3.13/site-packages/… But my docker image is using the python:3.12-slim-bookworm. Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements. Edit 2: Even if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking. image1027×510 11 KB Though an error occured in A8, A9 and A10 still could have worked if each of these function calls were enclosed in their own try-except blocks, ensuring independent checks for each task. But the current datagen.py script fails as error propagates to main, where it is not handled and causes abnormal termination without executing the functions for creating files for A9 and A10 as well.

The good thing with playground is our instances last for only 3 hrs and next day we try we are kind of gauranteed of fresh environment without any caches, Now after March 30th checkin validated the same in docker playground and ensured that the image got tagged and createdd successfully.. It would be great if the March 30th checkin could be considered, Again appreciate all your help so far.",

You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can run this code using uv. # /// script # dependencies = [ # \"requests\", # ] # /// import requests import datetime as dt import zoneinfo import argparse import os import zipfile parser = argparse.… That way you will be able to identify why the error was occuring. The specific error itself means: Docker is trying to run the command uv inside your container, but it can’t find the uv executable — it’s not installed or not in the system PATH inside the container. If you did not run evaluate.py as specified in our live sessions by recreating the test environment and then running evaluate.py then it would not have reflected how your dockerised application would work.

This is with reference to your confirmation mail that my project 1 will be re-evaluated after end term I would like to sincerely apologize for the oversight in my Project 1 submission. Upon reviewing my GitHub repository, I realized that the file was named dockerfile (with a lowercase ‘d’) in the Github root repo instead of the required Dockerfile (with an uppercase ‘D’). While the contents of the file were correct and my project passed several evaluation tests, I understand that the evaluation script could not detect the Dockerfile due to this naming issue. I genuinely did not intend to deviate from the standard, and I now fully understand the importance of following naming conventions precisely. I humbly request you to kindly consider this as an honest mistake and allow a one-time exception, Please sir. This issue has unfortunately resulted in my project score being reduced to 0, which puts my overall course performance at risk. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and such an error will not occur again in the future. So, I hope you will look at this and re-evaluate my project as I put lots of efforts to complete it. Thank you very much for your time and consideration. Warm regards, S.

Can you please look into it. Thankyou! Hi @22f3000585 Standard MIT License naming criteria is to be named as LICENSE or LICENSE.md(all caps). Adding a license to a repository - GitHub Docs Kind regards image931×108 3.89 KB Sir, this is why i renamed it to ‘MIT LICENSE’. Sir can you please consider it. Thank you! Same here. I also added and saved the file as MIT license because of the following message. I request you to please consider evaluating the project. Screenshot 2025-04-02 at 4.49.23 PM1776×228 15.5 KB @24ds2000125 @22f3000585 I completely appreciate that you feel these are minor issues. But the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly. Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites. Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible. These things do matter when done at scale. Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter. Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it. We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page. I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why. Kindest regards Sir, Thankyou for your prompt reply to my query. I wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’ on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the 16th of Feb itself). I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th. I completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it. Thankyou! One thing we are doing is looking at the latest commit before the 18th of Feb. So if it was correct before the 18th of Feb then we will consider it and evaluate it, but it has to be precisely what is expected. If so, then your submission will be evaluated by building the image from the docker manifest in the github present at the version before the 18th. Well noted sir. Thanks a lot! Sir, I received the mail today - image652×156 5.43 KB Sir, I had already added the LICENSE and changed it to’MIT LICENSE’ due to this reason before the deadline itself. image836×101 18.2 KB Sir,the rest of my prerequistes are working well.Can you please check as due to this my project has also not been evaluated.The MIT LICENSE file was already present in the github repo as I submitted my project’s github repo in the google form that was provided. image1113×487 20.2 KB Sir can you please check.

I request you to share module weightage (if it’s not secret). Please release mock as early as possible because this term course content has been changed so pyqs won’t help much. Thanks Sujay D @carlton, please release the mock or give us the proper resources. The resources in the course introduction and the pyqs have no similarities. Many questions come from other topics, such as MLT and many others. Those who didn’t complete it find it too difficult. Please don’t keep us in delusion. Going through GA’s would be good idea. Yes sir please it will help us to prepare better for end term. Yes sir we all are facing the same problem. The Tuesday and the Thursday session will cover end term including a mock. End term is usually very easy for TDS. A look at prior end terms is a good indicator of how easy they are. Kind regards @Carlton With just 5 days left, I wanted to ask for a quick suggestion. I’m prioritizing PYQs for sure, but between revisiting lectures and attending TA sessions (both quite time-consuming), which one would you recommend focusing on for better returns? Also, if possible, could you please point out the top 2–3 most important topics—maybe things like LLM, Data Sourcing, etc.—to give more attention to? I recommend attending the Tues and Thurs session this week or watching the recordings. Its the same every term, those that attend the session score the best marks. I say this because there is no way for me to convey in a discourse post all the important things to focus on. But I can do that in a 2 hour session. Practice PYQ Drive link provied in Tuesdays End term revision Session docs.google.com PYQ Sheet This Sheet is private Sir could you provide the recording for yesterday’s live session as in youtube its not uploaded yet Thank you Sir will the recent 3 pyqs be sufficient as the pyqs before 2024 are different compared to the recent ones.

      "content": "@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Greetings sir! Sir, I have a query about the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course. I’ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason? As the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation? Thank you and Regards Akshit Yes, I also missed the same assignment due to pressure from other courses. However, awarding a 5-mark bonus instead of a percentile-based system like GA4 seems quite different. Is this information available to everyone @carlton sir? Hello @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand sir, I hope you are doing well. As per the grading document, we were informed that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would be considered for grading. However, there was no mention of bonus marks, and before the deadline, we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7. Due to other academic commitments, such as Project 2, some of us were unable to complete GA7. Now, we have come to know that some of our peers have received an email stating that they have been awarded +5 bonus marks, which directly contribute to the final score. In some cases, this may even impact the final grade. Since this information was not communicated earlier, we kindly request you to consider providing an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn these bonus marks—perhaps through reviewing submissions or another form of assessment. We sincerely request your understanding on this matter and would be grateful if you could provide an opportunity for us to earn the bonus marks as well. Looking forward to your kind consideration. Best regards, Digvijaysinh Chudasama The Same happened to me. They should have informed this before. Hello @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand sir, I hope you are doing well.

Best regards, HARSH JAYSWAL @s.anand @carlton same happens for me also sir plz look into this matter. @carlton @s.anand There seems to be a sudden and unannounced change in the GA marking scheme, which feels quite arbitrary. Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15% weight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full marks in four GAs, I didn’t attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5 and GA6, which you can verify. Now I’m seeing in groups that there’s an “extra benefit” being given for GA7. If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be communicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance. I could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief — grading should be fair and consistent. Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if GA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to attempt or review it accordingly. @carlton, we request you to kindly consider this matter. We are looking forward to a quick response — hopefully one that ensures fairness for all students. @carlton sir , This would be a deviation from the grading format right sir? As some of us were proactive and closed the 4 GA requirement earlier, if such extra weightage is given to a certain GA unannounced then how is it fair on the other students ? Kindly consider same for me also … Please consider all the GA for the calculation and give bonus based on the overall performance in GA’s instead of one GA. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Exactly! This should have been informed beforehand. It’s really unfair It the team wants to give bonus marks then why specifically to peer review week-7 ? Like all the GAs were equally important ! So please do something about this. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand I have completed 5 GAs, but missed others due to the time commitment required, along with managing three other subjects and one project. I kindly request that 5 bonus marks be awarded to all, as the additional marks for GA were not communicated earlier. This could result in a disadvantage for those of us who were unaware of the extra marks for GA7. Thank you for considering this. Regards: Akash @carlton I genuinely wish I could respond more humbly, but the way this has unfolded makes it hard — and sadly, I’m not MSD to handle it all with silence and a smile. Good evening @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand Sir, I hope you are well According to the grading document, we were told that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would count towards our final grade. There was no mention of any bonus marks, and we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7 before the deadline. Because of other academic commitments like Project 2, some of us couldn’t complete GA7. Recently, we found out that some students received an email saying they’ve been given +5 bonus marks for GA7, which directly affects their final score and possibly their overall grade. Since this information wasn’t shared earlier, we kindly request you to consider offering an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn the bonus marks. This could be through a submission review or another form of assessment. We genuinely hope for your understanding and would be very grateful if you could provide a chance for us to earn the bonus marks too. Best regards, Palaash V.

Or it should have been informed earlier if such bonus was to be given . Please do consider our request . Thank you Exactly , They have to informed this earlier , that week 7 have peer marks too , and now bonus too in the grading doc , they removed peer marks , so i thought it was removed , but its not @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand The sudden introduction of bonus marks for GA7 in Tools in Data Science has left many students confused, as there was no prior intimation regarding this change. We had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated “best 4 out of 7” policy. This unexpected shift has raised concerns about transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic assessment. Fairness is not a privilege to be selectively granted; it is a fundamental right for every student. We respectfully urge the course coordinators to offer clarification and ensure that all students are evaluated on an equal footing. We hope the final grading reflects both justice and academic integrity. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand Yes Sir, I also completed 6 GAs even tho it was written only best 4 out of 7 GAs would be considered for final grade, but couldn’t complete GA 7 due to pressure of other subjects, if it was written in the grading document I would have done it, hoping you would understand Sir, Please do consider our request. Thank you @carlton sir in the grading document it was mentioned best 4 out of 7 assignments but I did 6 GAs but skipped GA7 due to other assignments and projects but now we got to know that 5 bonus marks are given in ga 7 which seems unfair to all of us as mostly people who did GA7 are the one who were not able to complete previous GAs so giving bonus for the last day give them a edge If it was announced before deadline of GA 7 it was okay and good for us to improve our grade but now it seems quite unfair so, please come with the best possible solution for this Thanking you waiting for your answer To all the people who are posting in this thread, I kindly request you to get the correct facts and data before starting a new thread. So here are the first steps towards making this thread a more informed one: What is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy document? What is the policy adopted in previous instances of TDS? Did anyone read the text related to bonus marks associated with GA7? Does anyone know what should be done to get the bonus? Has anyone inquired about effort involved in getting the bonus? After answering all the above, has someone actually tried to follow instructions in the “mail” to get the bonus? Patiently waiting for all your responses. @carlton @Jivraj this is really unfair, on one hand you all are giving 0 to project 1 submission even because of slighest mistake and on the other giving free marks to students who attempted the GA7. Most of us were not able to attend the GA7 and it was not mentioned beforehand that we have 5 marks bonus for GA7. Please give the peer review bonus to those who did not attempt the GA7 or else it is really unfair for other students. 23f1001524: on the other giving free marks to students who attempted the GA7 Please refer to my earlier post. Do try to answer the questions in those. And then try to argue with @carlton , @Jivraj and @Saransh_Saini about fairness. Greetings! I came across your response in the Discourse thread regarding the bonus marks and GA7, and I wanted to reach out respectfully to seek some clarification. I did go through the grading policy and the bonus marks section, but I’m still a bit confused about your message in the thread — especially regarding the specific steps we should take or refer to in order to understand the bonus marks related to GA7 and peer reviews. For ROE and the Week 4 GA, bonus marks were mentioned here on Discourse Could you kindly guide me on what exactly we should refer to (such as any email, document, or past policy) and what steps are expected from us to be eligible for the bonus? Also, would students who completed all 5 assignments (but missed GA7) have any alternative way to earn bonus marks through peer reviews or other contributions? Apologies if I’ve missed something already mentioned. Your clarification would be really helpful for me and others who are in a similar situation. @jkmadathil Thank you so much for your time and guidance. Warm regards, Mishkat Chougule I hope this message finds you well @jkmadathil sir. Firstly, I would like to sincerely apologize for any misunderstandings that may have arisen. I have the utmost respect for the grading system and for the esteemed professors at IITM, and I deeply value the effort put into the course. However, as a student, I am hoping to clarify the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course. Addressing the queries you raised in your post: What is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy document? In previous modules, such as Project 1, bonus marks were awarded for completing additional tasks (1 bonus mark per task if the code handled them correctly). Similarly, in GA4, bonus marks were given for replying in Discourse. These bonus marks, however, were specific to the respective modules and did not affect the final grading. What is the policy adopted in previous instances of TDS? I am not fully aware of the policies adopted in previous terms for the TDS course. Did anyone read the text related to bonus marks associated with GA7? I have read the email regarding GA7 and the associated bonus marks. The email states that: Dear Learner, DEADLINE: 10th April, 2025 23:59:59pm GA7 requires you to submit 3 peer evaluations, so that you may be graded for your submission. Please find the form link below to submit your evaluations. https://forms.gle/DhBW4xdKyv7hXhXD9 AFTER completing your initial 3 peer reviews which were sent in the previous email, if you submit 5 additional reviews, you will be awarded upto 5 BONUS MARKS to your final T score. For example if your final TDS score is 75, doing all 5 extra peer reviews can boost your final score in TDS to 80. You will have to submit the form 5 times (1 for each peer). Use the same form link to submit 5 different reviews. Your Bonus score will still be based on the metrics derived for the initial 3 peer reviews, but scaled for 5 peer reviews. You have been given the peer submissions as links to HTML files which you have to download and view in a browser. Does anyone know what should be done to get the bonus? From the information in the email, I infer that students who complete the additional reviews are eligible for bonus marks, which will be added to their overall total marks. Has anyone inquired about effort involved in getting the bonus? My peers and I have worked diligently to complete all required tasks, including the ROE and projects. Earning additional bonus marks is certainly a challenging milestone, and we understand that it requires considerable effort. After answering all the above, has someone actually tried to follow instructions in the “mail” to get the bonus? Unfortunately, I can’t follow the instructions because I did not receive the email about submitting extra peer reviews, as it appears to have been sent to those who participated in GA7. … Given this context, I would appreciate it if you could kindly clarify the situation for students who completed all GAs from 1 to 6 (or did their best 4 GAs) but did not participate in GA7. Specifically, I would like to understand why only those who completed GA7 are receiving the bonus marks email regarding peer reviews. Please note that I ask this purely for clarification and with the utmost respect for the professors and the grading system, as I have no intention of creating controversy. I simply wish to understand the criteria. Thank you for your time and consideration @jkmadathil sir. Best regards, Akshit Mittal 23f2004636: From the information in the email, I infer that students who complete the additional reviews are eligible for bonus marks, which will be added to their overall total marks. This is correct. 23f2004636: Earning additional bonus marks is certainly a challenging milestone, and we understand that it requires considerable effort. This is also correct. 23f2004636: Unfortunately, I can’t follow the instructions because I did not receive the email about submitting extra peer reviews, as it appears to have been sent to those who participated in GA7 The mail you have pasted has definitely come from one of your peer in the course. You can try clicking the form, evaluation criteria for reviews have been provided in the form itself. If in further doubt, try doing one review with the peer who shared the email. Now try answering Q5. And in case you have more doubts, you can refer to the live session that happened today. I believe most of it was spent on clarifying what the bonus is for. 23f2004636: Please note that I ask this purely for clarification and with the utmost respect for the professors and the grading system, as I have no intention of creating controversy. I simply wish to understand the criteria. Completely understand. And we too are trying to help you understand the criteria through these discussions. And believe me, we are also learning in the process. Yes @jkmadathil sir, I did receive this email from one of my peers, although we are not closely acquainted, making it difficult to complete a review with the peer who shared the email. Since the beginning of the course, it has been emphasized that the TDS course focuses more on teamwork and collaborative learning than individual study. I fully believe this concept and worked together with my group. I created Colab files for 4 GAs for my peers(more than 250 peers must have benefited from it), and my peers supported me with Project 1 and 2. They were mainly responsible for helping me score the full marks in the first two minutes of the ROE release and we had a meeting after ROE, which was scheduled with you. I understand that earning bonus marks for GA7 will be difficult. However, I had no opportunity to participate in this process even after submitting six GAs, while attempting only GA7 (which I understand presents a slim chance) may grant me 5 bonus marks. I acknowledge that the chances are difficult, but many of my peers who didn’t submit GA7, including myself, feel we deserve an opportunity. Sir, I am not questioning the grading system but I think it would have been helpful if we had known earlier that peer reviews in GA7 would be part of earning bonus marks. In GA4, Anand Sir made it clear that anyone who asked or answered a question in the GA4 discussion would receive bonus marks but these were specific to GA4 (e.g., a score of 110 out of 100), not the overall grading. To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. I am not pointing out mistakes, but I just feel the information about the bonus could have been shared more clearly. Finally, I want to thank everyone with whom I have connected during this course. I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible, especially after submitting six GAs, the ROE, and two projects. I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation. I’d also like to mention that with the end-term exams just three days away, most of us will be focusing on preparing for them. However, I trust you’ll definitely take our concerns into consideration, and we remain hopeful for clarity regarding the bonus marks. Thank you once again for your understanding. Hello sir, I too did not do the GA7 since the best 4 out of 7 would be considered and I had my college examinations during that time. I was not aware that doing reviews for GA7 would grant bonus marks and I have not received any mails regarding it. I agree with all my peers. If there was a bonus on the course grade T which would make a huge difference on the final grade I think it should have been told to us upfront. Bonus marks criteria should have been clarified before the deadline of week 7 GA so we all could have attempted it. It’s really unfair. We were not aware that doing reviews for GA7 would grant bonus marks and we have not received any mails regarding it. You could have informed us beforehand. 5 marks really makes a huge difference. I trust you guys to make it fair for everyone It is good to see that you have been actively collaborating with your peers and both have benefitted from this. Here is the main query that most people are having: 23f2004636: To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. Here is my response, and I have consulted with the course instructors before sharing this: Every term in TDS, both instructors and students are not aware of what bonuses are going to be given out at the start of term. Bonus activities are created at any point, at the discretion of the course team, and the information is not disseminated in a wide fashion. It’s primarily a reward mechanic for those that really are interested in engaging in the whole breadth of the course. For instance, in the last two terms the bonus activities required them to post their solutions in Discourse where the problem statement. The course team do not invent GAs for the sake of giving opportunities for scoring marks. They are opportunities to learn and put that learning to use. Another goal is for the GAs to be opportunities to learn by collaborating with each other. 192 students took that opportunity to engage with GA7. If no one is interested in doing the GA, then why should the team take the effort to create it? Would you rather prefer that we make it mandatory for all students to do all GAs (by making GAA = average of all GA Scores)? Some courses do that. We were very lenient in our GA scoring because the course is tough. Students benefitted from that leniency. Should we reverse our leniency so that everyone “gets the opportunity to get bonus marks?” Think about this As a course team, they did not know beforehand that they were going to give opportunities for any bonuses when GA 7 was created. So there was no information to give. Please do understand that the course team do not knowingly hide things from students (that’s a viewpoint that some students seem to suggest with their posts or at least). When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence? It is extraordinary that it appears you would prefer if those students, who actually put in the effort, would not be given the opportunity! You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. They thought it was worth the effort before there was any chance of a bonus. And now you begrudge them that reward for their own diligence. Once again reiterating this point - Bonus marks are given for activities to students at the discretion of the course team. It always has been. And it has never been widely available to all students in past terms of TDS either. This term is no exception. They are never decided beforehand. They are created as and when there seems to be an appropriate opportunity to reward students for their effort. The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. But it’s not guaranteed for them either. They have to put in a significant coordinated effort with their peers to actually achieve that. In other words, it’s not a freebie. I had promised to provide the distribution of people who did GA7 both in terms of number of assignments done and average score in GAA. Here is the data below: # Assignments Done # students 0 42 1 33 2 22 3 19 4 23 5 28 Assignment_Score # students 0-10 75 11-20 19 21-30 15 31-40 9 41-50 13 51-60 7 61-70 11 71-80 12 81-90 10 91-100 17 Thank you for sharing the data @jkmadathil Sir The data clearly supports my assumption that the majority of students attempted GA7 primarily to secure 100% in GAA, or to boost their GAA scores, with learning being a secondary priority. Anyway, it is what it is. Thankyou Sir Exactly and no one cares about that fact or try to understand it. @jkmadathil Sir, Thank you for the detailed explanation. I just have one sincere doubt: As you mentioned, the intention behind the GA7 bonus is to reward extra effort in GAs—but why are 5 bonus marks being added to the total course marks, instead of awarding 15/100 of the total to those who did GA7 exceptionally well? Students like me, who have consistently scored 100% in all GAs (excluding GA7) and have been actively participating in the Discourse forum from the beginning, seem to be left out. Don’t we deserve some recognition for our consistent efforts too? It’s not about jealousy—it’s about acknowledging those who have put in their day and night from the start, completing every GA diligently and earning bonus marks as per the criteria already defined for earlier GAs. I’m only concerned about my own marks, and I just wish for a fair system that values consistent effort across the term. Thank you for your time and understanding. @carlton @Jivraj Exactly my point, there is no mention about this. Bonus marks should be added out of 15 and not above that for T score calculation. Otherwise it SHOULD mentioned in Grading Document. Thanks for the clarification. I completely understand that bonus marks are at the discretion of the course team and are meant to reward diligence and deeper engagement — which is fair. However, I just want to point out a potential nuance: Many of the 192 students who did GA7 may have done so not for extra learning but simply to ensure their top 4 GAs included 4 full scores (e.g., to replace a lower-scoring GA). So the distinction between diligence-for-learning and diligence-for-grade-maximizing becomes blurred. Now that bonus marks are announced after the deadline, those who already had 4 perfect scores and skipped GA7 based on the stated structure (top 4 out of 7) are essentially penalized for playing the game by the original rules — not for a lack of diligence or engagement. I’m not questioning the bonus system itself, just pointing out that such surprises can unintentionally favor certain strategies over others — and more transparency around this in future terms might help students make better-informed decisions without second-guessing themselves later. Sir, why is GA7 given the atmost priority and the bonus of GA7 is not awarded to GA7 alone but is awarded as bonus to the entire total score of the course. If the team wants to award the bonus marks for the consistent performance then they should consider the best 5 or 6 GAs and award bonus accordingly. It is unfair that those who just attempted GA7 are been given bonus marks to the entire course. If you wish to provide bonus marks then provide the bonus marks for GA7 alone, the same way as it was done for GA4. The main issue is that the bonus marks concept was never informed prior. The team should not take actions at random as it would affect many students. As per grading document, only best 4 out of 7 GAs were supposed to be considered. Even if the team wishes to give the bonus mark then it should be given to the GA7 alone and not entire total score. Sir as per the current logic, say a person just attends GA7 alone and doesnt attend any another thing then he would also be awarded bonus 5 marks to his total score just because of the fact that they attended GA7. Whereas students who have been submitting Ga1 to 6 and werent able to submit GA7 alone as per current logic are not being considered for the bonus mark. This is unfair. Please think from our side. Regards Karthik jkmadathil: When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence? @jkmadathil Sir, this sounds reasonably fair. But, what about the students who were lethargic in probably week 1 or week 2, thinking that they can solve the GAs of later weeks? They also get benefitted from this. I think the attitude of these students is the same as those who skipped GA& as they got 100% GAA within the first five or six weeks I wanted to follow up on my previous message regarding the 5 bonus marks for GA7 and further elaborate on the impact this may have on overall grades. As outlined in the grading document, the best 4 out of 7 GA assignments carry a total of 15 marks. Since many students, including myself, scored well in our best 4 assignments, which were prioritized as we aimed to maximize our grades, we did not attempt GA7. The bonus marks for GA7 were announced after the deadline, which has led to a concern that this may create an imbalance in the overall grading. For students who excelled in their top 4 assignments, the additional 5 marks from GA7 may not significantly alter their overall grade, as they have already demonstrated strong performance. Conversely, those who struggled initially and attempted GA7 in hopes of improving their grade may benefit more from this bonus. This could inadvertently disadvantage those of us who strategically focused on the highest scoring opportunities available to us. Given that the bonus marks were introduced after grades were finalized, I respectfully ask if there’s a possibility to consider an adjustment in these Thank you for taking the time to respond in detail. I’d like to respectfully share a few clarifications in response to some of the points raised. jkmadathil: When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence? With due respect sir, I want to clarify that in my original message, I stated: “I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible…I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.” As mentioned above, my intention was never to express jealousy. It was simply an enquiry for clarity, especially around the communication and criteria related to the bonus system. The assumption that those who did not attempt GA7 chose not to put in effort is not accurate, respectfully. jkmadathil: You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. I would like to point out that many of us, myself included, showed consistent diligence by completing and submitting GA1 through GA6. Personally, I solved GA5 and GA6 even after solving my Best 4 GAs purely for the learning experience, knowing they wouldn’t necessarily impact my grade directly. I never avoided GA7 out of carelessness—I simply prioritized the fact that only the best 4 GA scores would count. This is not a lack of effort or interest in the subject matter. Further, you mentioned: jkmadathil: The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. I completely respect the effort put in by those students. However, I would like to offer another perspective: what if some among those 192 had not completed their best 4 GAs prior to GA7? Meanwhile, those of us who consistently completed all previous GAs(excluding GA7) from the start are now excluded from this opportunity—not due to lack of interest, but due to lack of communication. If the bonus is truly a recognition of effort specific to GA7, then it might be more fair to reflect that in the GA7 score only, not in the overall course total, which affects students who were consistently involved across the term. I know I’m still learning and have a long way to go—there’s so much about the world, professionalism, and fairness that I hope to understand better through experiences and guidance of professors and through the exposure from the college. But I also believe that seeking clarity is part of that learning. Thank you once again for reading my message and considering my point of view. Thank you for the response sir, however my doubt was regarding a different issue. It is not that I am jealous of their diligence or anything, its simply that even from the data you provided above, it seems that a majority of students, 141 out of the 192 students have not actually even done 4 assignments. So they might have done GA7 for the 4 GAA criteria, not just due to diligence. Once again I am not stating that they were all like that, but rather it is a possibility. Another issue is that a lot of students might have originally worked hard on earlier assignments to score well but may not have had the time for later assignments such as college students like myself who have end term examinations ongoing currently. Since I saw that I had already put in the effort to do all 6 assignments prior, I only did not do the GA7 since it clashed with my examinations. Once again I am not blaming the instructors for this situation sir but the bonus 5 marks can very well change which grade we get in the end, which is the reason why I have created this message. The students who have attempted GA7 do deserve extra marks for their work but if others were informed of the extra 5 marks then we may have also taken part in it, even if we had other prior commitments. Thank you once again for reading this message sir and kindly consider our point of view. @jkmadathil @carlton @s.anand @Jivraj Sir, as said in this another students’ post, i would also like to bring your notice to the fact that most of those 192 students who attempted the GA7 have not done 4 assignments. This shows their “diligence” which you are awarding them for. Whereas the students like us who have been submitting all the projects and the assignments GA1 to 6, how can the team conclude that just because we didnt submit GA7 we are not diligent enough to be awarded the bonus marks. Shouldnt the bonus marks be awarded to those students who have been submitting literally all 2 projects and 6 assignments(6/7 i.e 85% of the assignments)? How could the team decide to award bonus 5 marks to the overall score just to those students based on a single assignment( namely GA7). We are genuinely struggling, and we are requesting bonus marks based on that. Please don’t misunderstand our request as jealousy — it comes from a place of hardship. How can a student who submitted 1 assignment make him more diligent than those who have been submitting 2 projects and 6 assignments. I think if you plan to award bonus marks you should consider best 5 or 6 assignments and not just based on a single assignment. Just because we didnt submit a assignment(GA7) why are we being deprived of the bonus marks which was not even informed of. If you want to provide the bonus marks then you can also consider the best 4 assignments as well as it would also show the students’ interest and diligence as you said. If you want to consider for the bonus marks you can consider any assignment right, why just GA7 is the question. You can also award the bonus marks based of GA-1 or GA-2 or so. I think the diligence which are talking of, should be measured based on consistent performance and not just based on a single assignment. Regards Karthik @carlton @jkmadathil @s.anand sir, We have sent a couple of messages regarding the fairness of bonus marks to the above discourse post but no satisfactory reply has been provided. Could you please look into it and provide an update. We appreciate fairness in this matter. @s.anand Sir, I just wanted to request you to kindly look into the matter regarding the GA7 peer review bonus marks. Many of us are still waiting for a response on Discourse, and it’s becoming a bit concerning. Would really appreciate it if you could help us get some clarity on this. Thank you! Mishkat Chougule Hi everyone, A bit of data might be useful. Its been interesting reading all your posts, I thought I might share some brief insights. Firstly students vastly overestimate the ease of getting bonus marks in TDS. So of the approx 200 students that did GA7: The top bonus mark was 3. Only 2 students managed it. Going by that statistic, of the 600 students who are active in TDS, possibly 6 might have even managed to get 3 or more marks. So lets not pretend that this was easy by any stretch of the imagination. The mean bonus score was 1.27. So, on average, you would get less than a 1/3rd GAs worth of marks for the extra effort of an entire GA+extra work. The psychology study it revealed however is interesting on this thread to see. The difference between perception and reality. My advice is stop reacting emotionally and evaluate rationally. That is the data for you. Student Bonus600×371 7.62 KB Also noteworthy Bonus marks in TDS are never made known ahead of time for any term in the past and neither will it be in the future. None of us knew that there were going to be bonuses after the submission of GA7. Please stop requesting, “at least you should let us know before GA7”. How can we let you know, if we ourselves were not aware there were going to be bonus marks? Bonuses are always surprise opportunities that are not widely available to everyone. For example we never release them on the seek portal. In the past Anand has released them on discourse, where typically, in previous terms, less than a fraction of a third of the students are even engaged, let alone active. Of course students in the past complained saying, they did not know and were not informed. To which the response was, maybe you should be more actively engaged on discourse. How many people typically tried TDS bonus in the past? Probably around 50. So compared to previous terms, this term is a huge improvement! Bonuses are not a right. They are opportunities that become available for those that are engaged with the course. Where and when that opportunity becomes available varies. A bit like real life. However we have read all your concerns and we have decided to put a disclaimer in the grading document for future terms: Opportunities for bonus marks might become available for activities linked to any of the GAs, Projects or Course Modules. The may be revealed at anytime, on any platform (seek, discourse, course site) and through any medium (official email, discourse) at the discretion of the course team. Bonus marks are not guaranteed and are awarded at the discretion of the course team. @carlton Could you explain why so few students got good bonus marks? What was the criteria by which they were given? The rubric is challenging and requires some level of collaboration with others. Thats why the bonus marks are low. Also the there is minimum requirement for even being eligible for it, i.e. you must complete GA7 and give 3 peer reviews before you can even be considered for bonus eligibility. Hi @carlton sir and @Jivraj sir, Sir, As per your instructions, I had reached out to my peers well in advance; however, only 3 out of 8 responded. While 2–3 of the worksheets were publicly accessible, many remained private despite the ample time provided. This raises the possibility that the individual assigned to grade those particular sheets—aside from myself—may also not have had access, potentially affecting the overall grading accuracy. Additionally, I noticed that some worksheets were largely incomplete or just a single sheet was provided, and there is a chance that a few participants may have copy-pasted their own values because the if the sheet were provide and access wasn’t given, the probability of the correct values being there was really high, which could further influence the evaluations. Admittedly there were quite a lot of empty sheets too which I gave zero as deserved but this might not have been the case with other evaluators. Given these factors, I wanted to kindly request clarification on how these were handled. Was there a specific threshold required to qualify for the bonus, and how are such inconsistencies accounted Sir, some of us(including me) have submitted all 7 GAs and despite the end term we approached peers and completed all 8 reviews even when we had already got 90-110 in first four with average being 100 so I hope we could be graded fairly and appropriately for our efforts. I am frankly surprised by this outcome. I don’t see how there could have been large variances in scores different evaluators would have given to a student. I hope the data is not being skewed because of the total number of evaluations being low, or because of differing perceptions about how a student needs to be scored, or any other reason. SIGMA ADMIN Thank you for raising a proper point about the fairness of the issue. The course’s rules seems to be changed on a whim, which is pretty unfair to those of us who completed the first 6 assignments properly. If anything, why not inform the +5 bonus before declaring the GA-7. “Rewarding diligence” is a vague point as completing 6 out of 7 assignments requires a decent commitment to the course. Getting rewarded for completing all 7 assignments is something absolutely commendable, without a doubt but getting a +5 on the basis of simply GA-7 is vague because it doesn’t guarantee the commitment towards the other 6 assignments. A person who has completed 6 assignments, skipping GA 7 is less diligent than someone who completed 4 assignments including GA7 is the summary I am gathering : ) Please correct me if I am wrong",

          "answer": "23f2004636: From the information in the email, I infer that students who complete the additional reviews are eligible for bonus marks, which will be added to their overall total marks. This is correct. 23f2004636: Earning additional bonus marks is certainly a challenging milestone, and we understand that it requires considerable effort. This is also correct. 23f2004636: Unfortunately, I can’t follow the instructions because I did not receive the email about submitting extra peer reviews, as it appears to have been sent to those who participated in GA7 The mail you have pasted has definitely come from one of your peer in the course. You can try clicking the form, evaluation criteria for reviews have been provided in the form itself. If in further doubt, try doing one review with the peer who shared the email. Now try answering Q5. And in case you have more doubts, you can refer to the live session that happened today. I believe most of it was spent on clarifying what the bonus is for. 23f2004636: Please note that I ask this purely for clarification and with the utmost respect for the professors and the grading system, as I have no intention of creating controversy. I simply wish to understand the criteria. Completely understand. And we too are trying to help you understand the criteria through these discussions. And believe me, we are also learning in the process.",

          "answer": "It is good to see that you have been actively collaborating with your peers and both have benefitted from this. Here is the main query that most people are having: 23f2004636: To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. Here is my response, and I have consulted with the course instructors before sharing this: Every term in TDS, both instructors and students are not aware of what bonuses are going to be given out at the start of term. Bonus activities are created at any point, at the discretion of the course team, and the information is not disseminated in a wide fashion. It’s primarily a reward mechanic for those that really are interested in engaging in the whole breadth of the course. For instance, in the last two terms the bonus activities required them to post their solutions in Discourse where the problem statement. The course team do not invent GAs for the sake of giving opportunities for scoring marks. They are opportunities to learn and put that learning to use. Another goal is for the GAs to be opportunities to learn by collaborating with each other. 192 students took that opportunity to engage with GA7. If no one is interested in doing the GA, then why should the team take the effort to create it? Would you rather prefer that we make it mandatory for all students to do all GAs (by making GAA = average of all GA Scores)? Some courses do that. We were very lenient in our GA scoring because the course is tough. Students benefitted from that leniency. Should we reverse our leniency so that everyone “gets the opportunity to get bonus marks?” Think about this As a course team, they did not know beforehand that they were going to give opportunities for any bonuses when GA 7 was created. So there was no information to give. Please do understand that the course team do not knowingly hide things from students (that’s a viewpoint that some students seem to suggest with their posts or at least). When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence? It is extraordinary that it appears you would prefer if those students, who actually put in the effort, would not be given the opportunity! You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. They thought it was worth the effort before there was any chance of a bonus. And now you begrudge them that reward for their own diligence. Once again reiterating this point - Bonus marks are given for activities to students at the discretion of the course team. It always has been. And it has never been widely available to all students in past terms of TDS either. This term is no exception. They are never decided beforehand. They are created as and when there seems to be an appropriate opportunity to reward students for their effort. The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. But it’s not guaranteed for them either. They have to put in a significant coordinated effort with their peers to actually achieve that. In other words, it’s not a freebie. I had promised to provide the distribution of people who did GA7 both in terms of number of assignments done and average score in GAA. Here is the data below: # Assignments Done # students 0 42 1 33 2 22 3 19 4 23 5 28 Assignment_Score # students 0-10 75 11-20 19 21-30 15 31-40 9 41-50 13 51-60 7 61-70 11 71-80 12 81-90 10 91-100 17",

          "content": "I hope this message finds you well @jkmadathil sir. Firstly, I would like to sincerely apologize for any misunderstandings that may have arisen. I have the utmost respect for the grading system and for the esteemed professors at IITM, and I deeply value the effort put into the course. However, as a student, I am hoping to clarify the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course. Addressing the queries you raised in your post: What is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy document? In previous modules, such as Project 1, bonus marks were awarded for completing additional tasks (1 bonus mark per task if the code handled them correctly). Similarly, in GA4, bonus marks were given for replying in Discourse. These bonus marks, however, were specific to the respective modules and did not affect the final grading. What is the policy adopted in previous instances of TDS? I am not fully aware of the policies adopted in previous terms for the TDS course. Did anyone read the text related to bonus marks associated with GA7? I have read the email regarding GA7 and the associated bonus marks. The email states that: Dear Learner, DEADLINE: 10th April, 2025 23:59:59pm GA7 requires you to submit 3 peer evaluations, so that you may be graded for your submission. Please find the form link below to submit your evaluations. https://forms.gle/DhBW4xdKyv7hXhXD9 AFTER completing your initial 3 peer reviews which were sent in the previous email, if you submit 5 additional reviews, you will be awarded upto 5 BONUS MARKS to your final T score. For example if your final TDS score is 75, doing all 5 extra peer reviews can boost your final score in TDS to 80. You will have to submit the form 5 times (1 for each peer). Use the same form link to submit 5 different reviews. Your Bonus score will still be based on the metrics derived for the initial 3 peer reviews, but scaled for 5 peer reviews. You have been given the peer submissions as links to HTML files which you have to download and view in a browser. Does anyone know what should be done to get the bonus? From the information in the email, I infer that students who complete the additional reviews are eligible for bonus marks, which will be added to their overall total marks. Has anyone inquired about effort involved in getting the bonus? My peers and I have worked diligently to complete all required tasks, including the ROE and projects. Earning additional bonus marks is certainly a challenging milestone, and we understand that it requires considerable effort. After answering all the above, has someone actually tried to follow instructions in the “mail” to get the bonus? Unfortunately, I can’t follow the instructions because I did not receive the email about submitting extra peer reviews, as it appears to have been sent to those who participated in GA7. … Given this context, I would appreciate it if you could kindly clarify the situation for students who completed all GAs from 1 to 6 (or did their best 4 GAs) but did not participate in GA7. Specifically, I would like to understand why only those who completed GA7 are receiving the bonus marks email regarding peer reviews. Please note that I ask this purely for clarification and with the utmost respect for the professors and the grading system, as I have no intention of creating controversy. I simply wish to understand the criteria. Thank you for your time and consideration @jkmadathil sir. Best regards, Akshit Mittal",

          "content": "Yes @jkmadathil sir, I did receive this email from one of my peers, although we are not closely acquainted, making it difficult to complete a review with the peer who shared the email. Since the beginning of the course, it has been emphasized that the TDS course focuses more on teamwork and collaborative learning than individual study. I fully believe this concept and worked together with my group. I created Colab files for 4 GAs for my peers(more than 250 peers must have benefited from it), and my peers supported me with Project 1 and 2. They were mainly responsible for helping me score the full marks in the first two minutes of the ROE release and we had a meeting after ROE, which was scheduled with you. I understand that earning bonus marks for GA7 will be difficult. However, I had no opportunity to participate in this process even after submitting six GAs, while attempting only GA7 (which I understand presents a slim chance) may grant me 5 bonus marks. I acknowledge that the chances are difficult, but many of my peers who didn’t submit GA7, including myself, feel we deserve an opportunity. Sir, I am not questioning the grading system but I think it would have been helpful if we had known earlier that peer reviews in GA7 would be part of earning bonus marks. In GA4, Anand Sir made it clear that anyone who asked or answered a question in the GA4 discussion would receive bonus marks but these were specific to GA4 (e.g., a score of 110 out of 100), not the overall grading. To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. I am not pointing out mistakes, but I just feel the information about the bonus could have been shared more clearly. Finally, I want to thank everyone with whom I have connected during this course. I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible, especially after submitting six GAs, the ROE, and two projects. I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation. I’d also like to mention that with the end-term exams just three days away, most of us will be focusing on preparing for them. However, I trust you’ll definitely take our concerns into consideration, and we remain hopeful for clarity regarding the bonus marks. Thank you once again for your understanding.",

Here is the main query that most people are having: 23f2004636: To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. Here is my response, and I have consulted with the course instructors before sharing this: Every term in TDS, both instructors and students are not aware of what bonuses are going to be given out at the start of term. Bonus activities are created at any point, at the discretion of the course team, and the information is not disseminated in a wide fashion. It’s primarily a reward mechanic for those that really are interested in engaging in the whole breadth of the course. For instance, in the last two terms the bonus activities required them to post their solutions in Discourse where the problem statement. The course team do not invent GAs for the sake of giving opportunities for scoring marks. They are opportunities to learn and put that learning to use. Another goal is for the GAs to be opportunities to learn by collaborating with each other. 192 students took that opportunity to engage with GA7. If no one is interested in doing the GA, then why should the team take the effort to create it? Would you rather prefer that we make it mandatory for all students to do all GAs (by making GAA = average of all GA Scores)? Some courses do that. We were very lenient in our GA scoring because the course is tough. Students benefitted from that leniency. Should we reverse our leniency so that everyone “gets the opportunity to get bonus marks?” Think about this As a course team, they did not know beforehand that they were going to give opportunities for any bonuses when GA 7 was created. So there was no information to give. Please do understand that the course team do not knowingly hide things from students (that’s a viewpoint that some students seem to suggest with their posts or at least). When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence? It is extraordinary that it appears you would prefer if those students, who actually put in the effort, would not be given the opportunity! You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. They thought it was worth the effort before there was any chance of a bonus. And now you begrudge them that reward for their own diligence. Once again reiterating this point - Bonus marks are given for activities to students at the discretion of the course team. It always has been. And it has never been widely available to all students in past terms of TDS either. This term is no exception. They are never decided beforehand. They are created as and when there seems to be an appropriate opportunity to reward students for their effort. The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. But it’s not guaranteed for them either. They have to put in a significant coordinated effort with their peers to actually achieve that. In other words, it’s not a freebie. I had promised to provide the distribution of people who did GA7 both in terms of number of assignments done and average score in GAA. Here is the data below: # Assignments Done # students 0 42 1 33 2 22 3 19 4 23 5 28 Assignment_Score # students 0-10 75 11-20 19 21-30 15 31-40 9 41-50 13 51-60 7 61-70 11 71-80 12 81-90 10 91-100 17",

I just have one sincere doubt: As you mentioned, the intention behind the GA7 bonus is to reward extra effort in GAs—but why are 5 bonus marks being added to the total course marks, instead of awarding 15/100 of the total to those who did GA7 exceptionally well? Students like me, who have consistently scored 100% in all GAs (excluding GA7) and have been actively participating in the Discourse forum from the beginning, seem to be left out. Don’t we deserve some recognition for our consistent efforts too? It’s not about jealousy—it’s about acknowledging those who have put in their day and night from the start, completing every GA diligently and earning bonus marks as per the criteria already defined for earlier GAs. I’m only concerned about my own marks, and I just wish for a fair system that values consistent effort across the term. Thank you for your time and understanding. @carlton @Jivraj",

I completely understand that bonus marks are at the discretion of the course team and are meant to reward diligence and deeper engagement — which is fair. However, I just want to point out a potential nuance: Many of the 192 students who did GA7 may have done so not for extra learning but simply to ensure their top 4 GAs included 4 full scores (e.g., to replace a lower-scoring GA). So the distinction between diligence-for-learning and diligence-for-grade-maximizing becomes blurred. Now that bonus marks are announced after the deadline, those who already had 4 perfect scores and skipped GA7 based on the stated structure (top 4 out of 7) are essentially penalized for playing the game by the original rules — not for a lack of diligence or engagement. I’m not questioning the bonus system itself, just pointing out that such surprises can unintentionally favor certain strategies over others — and more transparency around this in future terms might help students make better-informed decisions without second-guessing themselves later.",

If the team wants to award the bonus marks for the consistent performance then they should consider the best 5 or 6 GAs and award bonus accordingly. It is unfair that those who just attempted GA7 are been given bonus marks to the entire course. If you wish to provide bonus marks then provide the bonus marks for GA7 alone, the same way as it was done for GA4. The main issue is that the bonus marks concept was never informed prior. The team should not take actions at random as it would affect many students. As per grading document, only best 4 out of 7 GAs were supposed to be considered. Even if the team wishes to give the bonus mark then it should be given to the GA7 alone and not entire total score. Sir as per the current logic, say a person just attends GA7 alone and doesnt attend any another thing then he would also be awarded bonus 5 marks to his total score just because of the fact that they attended GA7. Whereas students who have been submitting Ga1 to 6 and werent able to submit GA7 alone as per current logic are not being considered for the bonus mark. This is unfair. Please think from our side.

But, what about the students who were lethargic in probably week 1 or week 2, thinking that they can solve the GAs of later weeks? They also get benefitted from this.

As outlined in the grading document, the best 4 out of 7 GA assignments carry a total of 15 marks. Since many students, including myself, scored well in our best 4 assignments, which were prioritized as we aimed to maximize our grades, we did not attempt GA7. The bonus marks for GA7 were announced after the deadline, which has led to a concern that this may create an imbalance in the overall grading. For students who excelled in their top 4 assignments, the additional 5 marks from GA7 may not significantly alter their overall grade, as they have already demonstrated strong performance. Conversely, those who struggled initially and attempted GA7 in hopes of improving their grade may benefit more from this bonus. This could inadvertently disadvantage those of us who strategically focused on the highest scoring opportunities available to us. Given that the bonus marks were introduced after grades were finalized, I respectfully ask if there’s a possibility to consider an adjustment in these",

I’d like to respectfully share a few clarifications in response to some of the points raised. jkmadathil: When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence? With due respect sir, I want to clarify that in my original message, I stated: “I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible…I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.” As mentioned above, my intention was never to express jealousy. It was simply an enquiry for clarity, especially around the communication and criteria related to the bonus system. The assumption that those who did not attempt GA7 chose not to put in effort is not accurate, respectfully. jkmadathil: You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. I would like to point out that many of us, myself included, showed consistent diligence by completing and submitting GA1 through GA6. Personally, I solved GA5 and GA6 even after solving my Best 4 GAs purely for the learning experience, knowing they wouldn’t necessarily impact my grade directly. I never avoided GA7 out of carelessness—I simply prioritized the fact that only the best 4 GA scores would count. This is not a lack of effort or interest in the subject matter. Further, you mentioned: jkmadathil: The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. I completely respect the effort put in by those students. However, I would like to offer another perspective: what if some among those 192 had not completed their best 4 GAs prior to GA7? Meanwhile, those of us who consistently completed all previous GAs(excluding GA7) from the start are now excluded from this opportunity—not due to lack of interest, but due to lack of communication. If the bonus is truly a recognition of effort specific to GA7, then it might be more fair to reflect that in the GA7 score only, not in the overall course total, which affects students who were consistently involved across the term. I know I’m still learning and have a long way to go—there’s so much about the world, professionalism, and fairness that I hope to understand better through experiences and guidance of professors and through the exposure from the college. But I also believe that seeking clarity is part of that learning. Thank you once again for reading my message and considering my point of view.",

It is not that I am jealous of their diligence or anything, its simply that even from the data you provided above, it seems that a majority of students, 141 out of the 192 students have not actually even done 4 assignments. So they might have done GA7 for the 4 GAA criteria, not just due to diligence. Once again I am not stating that they were all like that, but rather it is a possibility. Another issue is that a lot of students might have originally worked hard on earlier assignments to score well but may not have had the time for later assignments such as college students like myself who have end term examinations ongoing currently. Since I saw that I had already put in the effort to do all 6 assignments prior, I only did not do the GA7 since it clashed with my examinations. Once again I am not blaming the instructors for this situation sir but the bonus 5 marks can very well change which grade we get in the end, which is the reason why I have created this message. The students who have attempted GA7 do deserve extra marks for their work but if others were informed of the extra 5 marks then we may have also taken part in it, even if we had other prior commitments.

This shows their “diligence” which you are awarding them for. Whereas the students like us who have been submitting all the projects and the assignments GA1 to 6, how can the team conclude that just because we didnt submit GA7 we are not diligent enough to be awarded the bonus marks. Shouldnt the bonus marks be awarded to those students who have been submitting literally all 2 projects and 6 assignments(6/7 i.e 85% of the assignments)? How could the team decide to award bonus 5 marks to the overall score just to those students based on a single assignment( namely GA7). We are genuinely struggling, and we are requesting bonus marks based on that. Please don’t misunderstand our request as jealousy — it comes from a place of hardship. How can a student who submitted 1 assignment make him more diligent than those who have been submitting 2 projects and 6 assignments. I think if you plan to award bonus marks you should consider best 5 or 6 assignments and not just based on a single assignment. Just because we didnt submit a assignment(GA7) why are we being deprived of the bonus marks which was not even informed of. If you want to provide the bonus marks then you can also consider the best 4 assignments as well as it would also show the students’ interest and diligence as you said. If you want to consider for the bonus marks you can consider any assignment right, why just GA7 is the question. You can also award the bonus marks based of GA-1 or GA-2 or so. I think the diligence which are talking of, should be measured based on consistent performance and not just based on a single assignment. Regards Karthik",

          "content": "Hi everyone, A bit of data might be useful. Its been interesting reading all your posts, I thought I might share some brief insights. Firstly students vastly overestimate the ease of getting bonus marks in TDS. So of the approx 200 students that did GA7: The top bonus mark was 3. Only 2 students managed it. Going by that statistic, of the 600 students who are active in TDS, possibly 6 might have even managed to get 3 or more marks. So lets not pretend that this was easy by any stretch of the imagination. The mean bonus score was 1.27. So, on average, you would get less than a 1/3rd GAs worth of marks for the extra effort of an entire GA+extra work. The psychology study it revealed however is interesting on this thread to see. The difference between perception and reality. My advice is stop reacting emotionally and evaluate rationally. That is the data for you. Student Bonus600×371 7.62 KB Also noteworthy Bonus marks in TDS are never made known ahead of time for any term in the past and neither will it be in the future. None of us knew that there were going to be bonuses after the submission of GA7. Please stop requesting, “at least you should let us know before GA7”. How can we let you know, if we ourselves were not aware there were going to be bonus marks? Bonuses are always surprise opportunities that are not widely available to everyone. For example we never release them on the seek portal. In the past Anand has released them on discourse, where typically, in previous terms, less than a fraction of a third of the students are even engaged, let alone active. Of course students in the past complained saying, they did not know and were not informed. To which the response was, maybe you should be more actively engaged on discourse. How many people typically tried TDS bonus in the past? Probably around 50. So compared to previous terms, this term is a huge improvement! Bonuses are not a right. They are opportunities that become available for those that are engaged with the course. Where and when that opportunity becomes available varies. A bit like real life. However we have read all your concerns and we have decided to put a disclaimer in the grading document for future terms: Opportunities for bonus marks might become available for activities linked to any of the GAs, Projects or Course Modules. The may be revealed at anytime, on any platform (seek, discourse, course site) and through any medium (official email, discourse) at the discretion of the course team. Bonus marks are not guaranteed and are awarded at the discretion of the course team.",

          "content": "Hi @carlton sir and @Jivraj sir, Sir, As per your instructions, I had reached out to my peers well in advance; however, only 3 out of 8 responded. While 2–3 of the worksheets were publicly accessible, many remained private despite the ample time provided. This raises the possibility that the individual assigned to grade those particular sheets—aside from myself—may also not have had access, potentially affecting the overall grading accuracy. Additionally, I noticed that some worksheets were largely incomplete or just a single sheet was provided, and there is a chance that a few participants may have copy-pasted their own values because the if the sheet were provide and access wasn’t given, the probability of the correct values being there was really high, which could further influence the evaluations. Admittedly there were quite a lot of empty sheets too which I gave zero as deserved but this might not have been the case with other evaluators. Given these factors, I wanted to kindly request clarification on how these were handled. Was there a specific threshold required to qualify for the bonus, and how are such inconsistencies accounted Sir, some of us(including me) have submitted all 7 GAs and despite the end term we approached peers and completed all 8 reviews even when we had already got 90-110 in first four with average being 100 so I hope we could be graded fairly and appropriately for our efforts.",

The course’s rules seems to be changed on a whim, which is pretty unfair to those of us who completed the first 6 assignments properly. If anything, why not inform the +5 bonus before declaring the GA-7. “Rewarding diligence” is a vague point as completing 6 out of 7 assignments requires a decent commitment to the course. Getting rewarded for completing all 7 assignments is something absolutely commendable, without a doubt but getting a +5 on the basis of simply GA-7 is vague because it doesn’t guarantee the commitment towards the other 6 assignments. A person who has completed 6 assignments, skipping GA 7 is less diligent than someone who completed 4 assignments including GA7 is the summary I am gathering : ) Please correct me if I am wrong",

      "content": "Hi @carlton and @Jivraj sir, I appeared for the end term examination held on 13th April 2025 during the FN shift. I would like to bring to your attention that the exam interface did not provide an option for multiple selections. However, a few questions appeared to have multiple correct answers. I have noted down the specific questions and the corresponding options I believe to be correct.So, kindly review them and let me know if there were any errors in my understanding of the questions. The questions are as follows: 10000425471080×578 187 KB Question 2: Fields needed to filter “POST requests under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays” To filter such logs, we need: Time → for the hour and the day (Monday) Method → to filter POST URL → to filter /images/ So, the correct minimal set is: Time, Method, URL Time → needed Method → needed URL → needed Referer → not needed, but not harmful So this option includes all the necessary fields, just with one extra — which doesn’t invalidate it. 10000425481080×301 71.5 KB Acc to solutions only option 6406534159827 is valid: Status is numeric (200) Method (GET), Protocol (HTTP/1.1), and URL (/index.html) are correct All required fields are present and properly formatted The other options were as follows: 9825 uses invalid protocol (INVALID) 9826 uses invalid status code (OK instead of numeric) 9824 has no critical issue — it is technically also valid (only uses a private IP 192.168.1.1, which is unusual but not invalid). So both 9824 and 9827 are valid, but the answer marked only 9827 10000425451079×468 35.7 KB Correct Answer(s): PUT – Correct: It replaces the resource entirely. Multiple identical PUTs = same result. GET – Also correct: It only fetches data, no side-effects. Multiple GETs = same result. DELETE – Technically correct: Deleting the same resource multiple times has the same result as deleting once (resource stays deleted). Incorrect Answer: POST – Not idempotent. Each POST usually creates a new resource or changes server state. (This is the mistake on my part that I put the ans as POST as I thought since 3/4 are idempotent and one is not I should select the odd one out but I hope this could be resolved) Thank you Agree & second all thoughts shared by @24f2003130 above. I also wanted to clarify on this question on filtered entries. The question mentions that a list filtered_entries is being created , and with the way the question is structured it seems like the filtering conditions mentioned in the question have already been applied. In that case len(filtered entries) seems to be correct. However the right answer is marked ‘None of these’ . image1108×394 81.9 KB The valid log entry had me stumped too, option 1 and 4 both look absolutely fine yet only option 4 is marked correct. Also, only POST request is not idempotent, all other requests are idempotent yet only PUT is marked correct. Request you to please clarify and consider these points. Yes @carlton the wording of the question made it seem like the filters were already applied on the list filtered_entries. Clarifications on Queries Which of the following is a valid log entry based on the provided format? Due to a technical issue in the portal, both options 1 and 4 are correct answers. The final scoring has been adjusted accordingly, and full marks will be awarded for either response. HTTP method is idempotent This question has been excluded from scoring as three methods (GET, PUT, and DELETE) are idempotent, with only POST being non-idempotent. Entries with 404 status code Although the instructions did not explicitly state that filters applied for status code 404, we acknowledge this ambiguity. Full credit will be awarded for both option 1 and option 4. Which of the following fields are necessary to filter “POST requests made for pages under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays”? Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL) is correct because: Option B includes Size and Status, which aren’t needed for filtering by time, method, and URL Option C includes Referer, which is unnecessary unless filtering by source page Option D includes Status and Server, which aren’t relevant for this specific filtering requirement Thank you for the clarification provided regarding Question 4 and resolution of errors in other questions. I understand the reasoning behind choosing Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL). However, I respectfully believe Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) is more accurate for the following reasons: Redundancy in Option A: The Request field already contains the HTTP method, URL, and protocol (e.g., “POST /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1”). Including both Request and separate Method and URL fields introduces redundancy. If we already extract Method and URL separately for filtering, the full Request field becomes unnecessary. Simplicity in Filtering: Filtering for “POST requests under /images/” from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays can be done using: Time → for checking the hour and weekday. Method → to filter only POST. URL → to ensure the request is under /images/. Thus, Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) already includes all needed fields. While Referer is not essential, it doesn’t interfere with the filtering and might be useful in future extended filtering cases (e.g., source tracking). Therefore, Option C is complete and accurate without being redundant. Consistency with Log Parsing Practices: In most log analysis scripts or systems (e.g., Python’s re or pandas parsing of logs), Method and URL are parsed from Request for separate use. This further supports the idea that including Request alongside Method and URL is not best practice. Sir, regarding point 3, score-checker tells a different story. While all the other changes have been made with the same reflecting in the score, that question still says “The question and answer remain the same . No changes required”, which is different from your post. image923×352 72 KB Can you please look into it? Thanks Regards, Shivaditya @iamprasna sir , the scores have been updated on the dashboard as well and the answer for the question in point 3 is still the same Additionally , sir I have attached the snapshot of a dec’24 TDS PYQ which is a replica of this question and the answer for the same is mention the first option. 10000427961080×538 84.7 KB The link for the same has been attached for your referance drive.google.com IIT M FOUNDATION DIPLOMA FN EXAM QDF2 22 Dec 2024.pdf Google Drive file. That’s a great find. They’re the same question with just different parameters. Please look into it @iamprasna sir. @carlton sir and @Jivraj sir please look into this question and clarify this Thank you Hi, From where are you checking the transcripts? I’m not able to see the answer transcripts in the score checker app. image1891×622 31.7 KB Click on the eye button …then you will be able to view your transcript Thanks for the reply, but I only see the question id’s and answer id’s, not able to find the transcripts. image1867×923 94.1 KB It seems that the option to download the answer key has been removed. However, you could consider reaching out to someone in the group or checking the dashboard for solution pdf of question paper. You can then match the questions in order, even if the IDs don’t align exactly—it should still give you a general idea. From there, you can proceed accordingly. @iamprasna @carlton Please look into it once. According to point 3 of @iamprasna’s post, I should get full credit for that question and it will take me to a perfect 100 score in ET from the current 97. I brought this into attention before the scores were pushed to the dashboard. Regards, Shivaditya The correction has been done to the following question for both the FN and AN sessions. You must be able to see the change in scores shortly Entries with 404 status code Although the instructions did not explicitly state that filters applied for status code 404, we acknowledge this ambiguity. Full credit will be awarded for both option 1 and option 4. Thank you sir for acknowledging our requests and resolving the error",

This inconsistency has resulted in a correct answer being marked as incorrect, despite the fact that the same query was previously accepted by the evaluation script of Graded Assignment without any issue. Such ambiguity in the evaluation process is concerning and leads to confusion and unfair penalization of students. I respectfully request that you review this matter and ensure that the evaluation criteria are consistent across the evaluation scripts. Denying marks due to technical discrepancies in the evaluation scripts, rather than the correctness of the SQL query itself, is unjust. This issue has severe repercussions: If unresolved, it will unjustly lower my overall course grade despite submitting a correct solution. Such an outcome, resulting from no fault of my own, is deeply concerning and undermines the fairness of the evaluation process. I kindly request that you reconsider my submission and award the marks that are rightfully due.

Hi Premdeep, We will update your score to consider \\n for SQL query. I had briefly read your post and incorrectly assumed that the script was not handling newline characters (which are invisible whitespaces). The prescription given by Anand in a live session exclusively conducted by him was clear. We should be able to copy paste your answer from the JSON response and put it in the GA and it should work. There only some notable exceptions, and this is where formatted text is expected. This question does not require formatted text, but it does require handling of quotes. Your response has literal a \\ and literal n characters. It fails the copy paste test. If it had the invisible actual new line characters encoded then it would be parsed correctly. In your own image that you shared you did not copy paste the return response of your function into your GA. I also looked at your repo and the mistake you made for this question was you used a multiline string for the SQL query. The result of the json.dumps for this question (which does not require or expect formatted text) would end up with \\n that we do not parse. We are only parsing for quotes which our script does handle. As a result, I would like to reiterate, your return fails the copy paste test. Therefore we will not be able to award you marks for this. There are many students who got this correct. I suggest you to check out some of their repos to see why they were able to get the right answer. Kind regards TDS Team @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Dear Sir, The required tag, <!--email_off-->, is indeed present in my deployed site at https://23f1001231.github.io/testsite/, as can be verified directly. Furthermore, this exact implementation was previously evaluated successfully and accepted as correct by the evaluation script for Graded Assignment 2, demonstrating its validity. Github repo link : https://23f1001231.github.io/testsite/ image1094×298 61.6 KB image1056×355 37.1 KB image928×161 11.5 KB Video proof below shows my solution as correct and valid by the evaluation script of the Graded Assignment. The error in Project 2 appears to arise from the evaluation script’s handling of the tag—specifically, its use of a regex that fails to detect <!--email_off--> when it follows an <a> element. This is a technical flaw in the evaluation process, not an issue with my solution. The inconsistency between the evaluation scripts for the Graded Assignment and Project 2 has resulted in a correct answer being unfairly marked as incorrect. Such ambiguity in automated evaluation is deeply concerning and leads to confusion and unwarranted penalization of students. Denying marks due to technical discrepancies in the evaluation scripts, rather than the correctness of the submitted solution, is unjust. If this issue remains unresolved, it will negatively and unfairly impact my overall course grade, despite my submission being fully correct and in line with assignment requirements. This outcome, caused by factors outside my control, undermines the integrity and fairness of the evaluation process. I respectfully request that you review my discrepancy issue in light of these facts and ensure that evaluation criteria are applied consistently. I kindly request you to reconsider my solution and award the marks that are rightfully due. Thank you for your attention and understanding.

Just check with one of the peer who have got this correct.” Thanks, TDS Team @carlton @s.anand @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Sir I wanted to respectfully bring to your attention a concern regarding the evaluation of my Project 2 submission. My project is functioning properly in my browser, but it doesn’t use http or https in the URL—it’s accessed directly without a protocol. I believe this might have caused an issue with the evaluation script, rather than an actual error in my submission. I’d like to kindly request that the evaluation script be updated to account for such cases, as the core requirements of the project were fulfilled to the best of my understanding. With due respect, I’ve invested a lot of time and effort into this project, and it’s disheartening to see that a technicality might affect the evaluation. We’ve studied exception handling in both Java and Python—so I was a bit curious (asking respectfully, of course!) why there wasn’t similar handling in the evaluation logic for edge cases like mine. I completely understand the depth of your knowledge, and I say this with all humility—I’m just trying to understand and express a genuine concern. I don’t have professional experience in web or app development, but my cousin, who works in tech, told me that even in real-world projects, bugs can appear after deployment. That’s why we have QA and support teams in companies (or so I’ve been told!). To be honest, I initially thought TDS would be easier compared to Java, PDSA, or SC. Ironically, I’ve cleared all four subjects this term, including both projects—except TDS, where Project 2 has become a bit of a nightmare. Without the Project 2 score, I might end up passing with just an ‘E’ grade, which would hurt my overall CGPA. Worse, I’d have to repeat the course and pay the fee again—which isn’t covered under the CSR fund. So, with the utmost respect and sincerity, I request you to please consider re-evaluating my submission using the updated endpoint. Not just for me, but there are several students whose hopes are resting on this project’s score. Updating the script shouldn’t affect students who already scored well, but it might help a few others avoid repeating the course unnecessarily. I’m not asking for bonus marks or any special treatment—just a fair second look. As a law student (LLB), I deeply respect rules and processes. I only ask this in the spirit of fairness and with full respect for your time and effort. Please consider this message as a humble and respectful request—I’m just exercising my right to politely express a concern. We have made the update to your score and awarded you 4 marks (out of 20) for your endpoint. Kind regards @carlton So, marks will be awarded for both the questions I mentioned? @carlton So, marks will be awarded for both the questions I mentioned? … @carlton ?? …_______… @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand Please response. Efficient communication is very important in this type of course. You already got an A and more marks will not change the grade. You have received an increase in your P2 score and that is reflected in your t score. Sir can you please check my post URGENT wrong score on dashboard - #2 i got 70 in my mail for official score and now it shows 54 in my dashboard i have no clue whats going on @carlton Please reply me on this post URGENT ATTN REQ: technical discrepancy and inconsistency in the evaluation scripts of graded assignment and project 2 - #4 The course team and operations have consulted on this. We will not be able to make an allowance for this request because the rule was applied uniformly for everyone. Kind regards @jkmadathil Kindly ask developer to look into this. Thanks PS. There seems to be portal error that has nothing to do with the course team, Operations has been notified that there is a glitch on their front end that is showing the wrong grades and scores. Please wait for them to fix it. I just wanted to request a re-evaluation of my project. I got 0 marks, but my deployed project is working fine and meets all the prerequisites mentioned. I had updated the domain using the API and submitted the correct link through the Google Form, but I think it was evaluated using the old domain. Also, one of my friends got 80 without HTTPS, so I’m a bit confused about the criteria. I’m not asking for an S or A grade—just a fair evaluation. I’ve put in a lot of effort and really don’t want to pay the fee again to repeat the course, especially since I already got 0 in P1. I hope you can please take another look.

The marks in question are not trivial. If the corrections are made as promised, my overall course percentage will increase by a minimum of 6%. This is a substantial change that directly affects my academic record. The assertion that “more marks will not change the grade” overlooks the broader implications of accurate and fair assessment. It is a fundamental principle of academic integrity and fairness that students receive the marks they have rightfully earned. Denying the correction of a clear and acknowledged error constitutes an unjust deprivation of my rightful academic standing. Such actions may not align with the principles of due process. I respectfully request that you to update my Project 2 score to accurately reflect the corrections as confirmed by @carlton , provide a clear clarification of my revised Project 2 score (out of 100) and ensure that my overall course percentage is recalculated accordingly. Hello Sir, I kindly request reevaluation for project 2 as its still showing 0 and I don’t see any logs in my endpoint Also for assignment 1 grades tab( below modules tab) is showing 100 by on dashboard its reflecting 65 . Sir please have a look. @carlton Project 2 marks update Sir I am a degree potential student and i got 35 marks with U grade in TDS. My project 2 marks are not added. The reason is one of my mistake that i misunderstood that we have to provide browser link for the project 2 instead of api one. I am aware of two mails from TDS team side to update the url but my browser link was working perfectly so did not updated it and when results came it said that 405 errror. and i got 0 marks. I am giving the correct api link here : https://tdssolver-7s6meq5el-akbar-alis-projects-e047c36e.vercel.app/api/ Please sir help me about it. I am a degree potential student and i will have to take TDS only in my next term. Please help me sir i just need 5 marks. Please reevaluate me Sir. One more thing is that when i tried to send post request using powershell, curl was not working so i had to use something else. like … Define the endpoint and the question $uri = “https://tdssolver-7s6meq5el-akbar-alis-projects-e047c36e.vercel.app/api/” $questionText = “What is 17 multiplied by 8?” Create the content body as form-urlencoded $body = @{ question = $questionText } Send the POST request $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $uri -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType “application/x-www-form-urlencoded” Show the result $response image1062×415 22.4 KB Please refer to this post.

Denying the correction of a clear and acknowledged error constitutes an unjust deprivation of my rightful academic standing. Such actions may not align with the principles of due process. We have you scored currently at 12 out of 20. You asked for a fair evaluation. You actually should be scored 8 out of 20, reducing your T score from 82 to 78, just out of maintaining the principle of fairly evaluating everyone. This will result in a grade change for you. If you still want a fair evaluation we are happy to forward your request to operations. @jkmadathil has been consulted on this and course team together has looked at your grievance and we have made it publicly visible so that it can be judged fairly. Kind regards Hi @23f1002997 It’s unfortunate that you had to go through this, but since it was your mistake to not update your URL despite repeated notifications, under whatever assumptions, there is nothing we can do. I can understand that a small mistake like this has lead to a setback for a term, and honestly I can relate very strongly with this. But take it as a life lesson and try to score well in the next term. Best wishes Saransh Saini Hi @Algsoch, Case 1: This might be an error. Send me your github pages endpoint I’ll have a look. Case 2: Question asked for the recent post where 2FA was mentioned with at least 95 points. Case 3: Question asked for the number of times key “Y” appears. Hi @23f1001231 Your submission was validated by the course portal, so it testifies its correctness. But I want to clarify our side. I checked your response. The problem is not that your tag is present in <a> tags. Its because your closing email_off tag doesn’t have a slash as mentioned in the question page. Moreover this was specifically mentioned in the question we sent you in the API request. \"Publish a page using GitHub Pages that showcases your work. Ensure that your email address 23f1001231@ds.study.iitm.ac.in is in the page's HTML. GitHub pages are served via CloudFlare which obfuscates emails. So, wrap your email address inside a: <!--email_off-->23f1001231@ds.study.iitm.ac.in<!--/email_off--> What is the GitHub Pages URL? It might look like: https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/\" So, in short it wasn’t a bug in our script, rather leniency given by the course portal. github.com GitHub - algsoch/portfolio-1744830932: Portfolio page for 24f2006438@ds.study.iitm.ac.in Portfolio page for 24f2006438@ds.study.iitm.ac.in @carlton please look into this!!!

The build is successful and the dockerimage is also running sir. I have attached the screen shot below Screenshot 2025-04-12 1153421466×702 50.4 KB Sir, But I couldn’t run the last command you gave, uv run evaluate.py --email <any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000 As I dont have evaluate.py But, the DockerImage is built and is running without error sir. Please guide me after this sir Thank You So much sir Sir, I already posted before 10 days, I didn’t get any reply. I am posting again Good Afternoon Sir. This is regarding project 1 and project 2. Project-1 Evaluation Sir, For the project 1, I have written the code, uploaded in GitHub and the dockerfile image is created and uploaded successfully. Sir, I already contacted regarding Project - 1, you said to check it by replicating the test environment. I did till running the dockerfile but I needed evaluate.py sir, which I didn’t get it. I got only 5 marks sir. Can you please check my code once sir and verify it as I have written the code and the dockerfile is running successfully. Project-2 Evaluation Regarding project 2 also, I have uploaded my code in GitHub and deployed my app in Vercel. But, I got 0 sir. Can you check my code once again and verify it? According to the guidance given, I deployed my app through Vercel. The app got deployed but I am getting 404 Error, even after trying any troubleshooting method. Maybe, Vercel is in development stage. Sir, but I wrote the code and deployed, but I got 0 marks only. Please check it and guide me to get it corrected. Sir, due to the projects I got poor marks on TDS. Please, I request you to re-evaluate and give me correct marks. In anticipation of quick response Thank You Sir, I have filled the E-Mail for discrepancy, but there is no change. Please help me out sir. Thank You Project 1 : You tried to copy parent folder(Ref:line number 8 in your Dockerfile) but there is no parent folder with respect to github repo’s root folder, so it fails evaluation. Project 2 : Response we received through google form was http://127.0.0.1:8000/api which is local host url not a vercel endpoint.",

The result of the json.dumps for this question (which does not require or expect formatted text) would end up with \\n that we do not parse.

          "content": "@carlton @s.anand @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Sir I wanted to respectfully bring to your attention a concern regarding the evaluation of my Project 2 submission. My project is functioning properly in my browser, but it doesn’t use http or https in the URL—it’s accessed directly without a protocol. I believe this might have caused an issue with the evaluation script, rather than an actual error in my submission. I’d like to kindly request that the evaluation script be updated to account for such cases, as the core requirements of the project were fulfilled to the best of my understanding. With due respect, I’ve invested a lot of time and effort into this project, and it’s disheartening to see that a technicality might affect the evaluation. We’ve studied exception handling in both Java and Python—so I was a bit curious (asking respectfully, of course!) why there wasn’t similar handling in the evaluation logic for edge cases like mine. I completely understand the depth of your knowledge, and I say this with all humility—I’m just trying to understand and express a genuine concern. I don’t have professional experience in web or app development, but my cousin, who works in tech, told me that even in real-world projects, bugs can appear after deployment. That’s why we have QA and support teams in companies (or so I’ve been told!). To be honest, I initially thought TDS would be easier compared to Java, PDSA, or SC. Ironically, I’ve cleared all four subjects this term, including both projects—except TDS, where Project 2 has become a bit of a nightmare. Without the Project 2 score, I might end up passing with just an ‘E’ grade, which would hurt my overall CGPA. Worse, I’d have to repeat the course and pay the fee again—which isn’t covered under the CSR fund. So, with the utmost respect and sincerity, I request you to please consider re-evaluating my submission using the updated endpoint. Not just for me, but there are several students whose hopes are resting on this project’s score. Updating the script shouldn’t affect students who already scored well, but it might help a few others avoid repeating the course unnecessarily. I’m not asking for bonus marks or any special treatment—just a fair second look. As a law student (LLB), I deeply respect rules and processes. I only ask this in the spirit of fairness and with full respect for your time and effort. Please consider this message as a humble and respectful request—I’m just exercising my right to politely express a concern.",

The marks in question are not trivial. If the corrections are made as promised, my overall course percentage will increase by a minimum of 6%. This is a substantial change that directly affects my academic record. The assertion that “more marks will not change the grade” overlooks the broader implications of accurate and fair assessment. It is a fundamental principle of academic integrity and fairness that students receive the marks they have rightfully earned. Denying the correction of a clear and acknowledged error constitutes an unjust deprivation of my rightful academic standing. Such actions may not align with the principles of due process. I respectfully request that you to update my Project 2 score to accurately reflect the corrections as confirmed by @carlton , provide a clear clarification of my revised Project 2 score (out of 100) and ensure that my overall course percentage is recalculated accordingly.",

The reason is one of my mistake that i misunderstood that we have to provide browser link for the project 2 instead of api one. I am aware of two mails from TDS team side to update the url but my browser link was working perfectly so did not updated it and when results came it said that 405 errror. and i got 0 marks. I am giving the correct api link here : https://tdssolver-7s6meq5el-akbar-alis-projects-e047c36e.vercel.app/api/ Please sir help me about it. I am a degree potential student and i will have to take TDS only in my next term. Please help me sir i just need 5 marks. Please reevaluate me Sir. One more thing is that when i tried to send post request using powershell, curl was not working so i had to use something else. like … Define the endpoint and the question $uri = “https://tdssolver-7s6meq5el-akbar-alis-projects-e047c36e.vercel.app/api/” $questionText = “What is 17 multiplied by 8?” Create the content body as form-urlencoded $body = @{ question = $questionText } Send the POST request $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $uri -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType “application/x-www-form-urlencoded” Show the result $response image1062×415 22.4 KB",

The prescription given by Anand in a live session exclusively conducted by him was clear. We should be able to copy paste your answer from the JSON response and put it in the GA and it should work. There only some notable exceptions, and this is where formatted text is expected. This qu… Your logs have been shared with you. But I have pasted it here as a reference.

Denying the correction of a clear and acknowledged error constitutes an unjust deprivation of my rightful academic standing. Such actions may not align with the principles of due process. We have you scored currently at 12 out of 20. You asked for a fair evaluation. You actually should be scored 8 out of 20, reducing your T score from 82 to 78, just out of maintaining the principle of fairly evaluating everyone. This will result in a grade change for you. If you still want a fair evaluation we are happy to forward your request to operations. @jkmadathil has been consulted on this and course team together has looked at your grievance and we have made it publicly visible so that it can be judged fairly.

The sleepless nights cursing my laptop for freezing while my docker image installed huge CUDA libraries with sentence-transformers; and then finding ways to make sure it does not, and then getting rid of the library itself, it’s just one example of how I was forced to become better by finding better solutions to multiple problems. This is one of the hardest, most frustrating and the most satisfying learning experience I’ve ever had, besides learning ML from Arun sir. @s.anand sir did a tremendous job of designing this course. I feel this course ties every other course together by applying learnings from each course and building further upon them. I learnt development in python and APIs in MAD-1, JS in MAD-2, bash scripting in SC, SQL in DBMS, data structures in PDSA and TDS had applications of each. In MAD projects, we made an app and submitted it as zip file. Here we went on to learn to containerise our app and deploy and also make the process automated. Our apps combined python and shell scripting along with the power of LLMs. Yeah the projects did seem extremely overwhelming but the learning is invaluable. @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @carlton I’m sure it wasn’t an easy task being the TA of this course. Thanks for all the help throughout the term with the Mock ROEs, project sessions and clearing doubts in discourse and live sessions. I still got an S grade but it was a very hard-fought S with the help of some luck. I’d love to follow the changes this course goes through in the upcoming terms. Thanks Regards, Shivaditya Bhattacharya Hi @22f3000819, First of all congratulations on scoring a S grade in the subject claimed to be the hardest of all in the program, its truly a feat of its own. This post reminds me of the farewell post I wrote for my TAs @carlton and @Amit1 back in May’24 term when I was a student of TDS. This course is more of an experience that a student goes through. The sleepless nights for projects, the thrill and rush of the ROE, and the satisfaction of an easy End Term . This course builds the confidence within a person to face challenging scenarios and a believe to come at the top of it. Honestly, I learnt a lot about being a TA in this course. It was an experience worth living. So, thank you Shivaditya, looking at students like you, it feels like our efforts paid off. All the best for your next term. Best Wishes Saransh Saini TDS TA This course was the most exciting and memorable of all the courses I have taken so far (actually of all the courses in the diploma level, I have completed all by now ). I had the technical background and as @22f3000819 mentioned I thought it was going to be an easy ride but I was wrong. It was challenging as well as fun at the same time. The best part of the course is that it is open internet and we are free to explore, use LLMs and get the things done. This way of learning to me is the most effective. I have the guide and now I can devise how I should approach the things. Everything ROE, Project 1, Project 2 was quite challenging and fun at the same time. Projects were the best part of the course. I learned how things can go wrong when we deploy it. I collaborated with @ItsMeAlex , @trebhuvansb , @23f1002382 and @22f3002933 for Project 2. My Project 2 repo even got 17 forks and 4 stars and scored 20/20 on evaluation. This adventure ended with the relaxing end term paper and an overall “S” grade. Also I must say the support team of TDS is the best so far in the program. I had conversation with @Jivraj , @Saransh_Saini and @carlton sir and they are super helpful. I would really miss these sessions. I attended the live sessions by @s.anand sir and sir’s take on the questions were really insightful and even made me think differently than my perspective. When we do something different it ought to have challenges both operational and technical but the TDS support team tried to give its best. Many a times I too had raised concerns but the team tried to resolve it to their best capabilities. At last I would like to say, without any hesitation, I had experienced the best part of the program till now in the last 3-4 months. Hoping to meet the team and my fellow peers in person during the Paradox . Thanks & Regards Pradeep Mondal My TDS Journey “A Tale of Bugs, Chaos & Miraculous Comebacks” So, I did something bold (or reckless, depends on how you see it)—took the TDS (Tools in Data Science) course right in my first term. Why? Because curiosity got the better of me, and I thought, “Eh, GA1 went fine, how hard could it be?” (Spoiler: Very hard.) Not a decision I recommend unless you’re into academic masochism. The first few modules hit me like three courses merged into one . Maybe because I was totally unprepared, maybe because TDS has a secret pact with chaos. Did all 7 GA …it was very time consuming but fun too …learnt new tools with every question. But hey, the live lectures were fantastic , the modules were well-structured , and thank goodness for the lifesaving Discourse forum and group, where the real MVPs reside . Then came Project 1. Ah yes, my nemesis. I’d write code, it would run perfectly, then—bam! A random error just to keep things from getting doable⚠️. Was it 404? 500? Who knows! I basically developed muscle memory for every error code in existence . The grand result? 2/20. At this point, my grade looked like it had fallen off a cliff , and I wasn’t sure if I could salvage an B—or even a C, honestly… with -18 in my balance due to P1 and a trauma for P2 I couldn’t have expected more… no? Entered the TA sessions and peer-powered survival squad —my saving grace. ROE, the supposedly impossible exam, where I thought even a 50% would be a miracle?..got 100%. Same for Project 2—100%. Even after initially refusing to believe it, reality set in, and my **end-term score also landed around 90 ** (thanks to the PYQs and those 300 github ques…definitely recommending the next term student to solve and understand all the pyqs fr), then wrapping the final score with some gift wrappers of a few bonus marks… this deal got sealed with a confident A … .…drumrolls… An A. This course was brutal, but in the best way possible . It threw me into battles with LLMs, never-ending questions, and existential crises over debugging . But now, I have actual skills (and scars) that I’ll carry into my future projects of MAD1, MAD2, MLP, and BDM which will be a whole new experience🚀. Looking back, the syllabus was a wild mix of survival skills and superpowers—building models, deploying them, wrestling with LLMs, and somehow convincing messy data to behave. And just when we thought we had conquered it all, Project 1 pulled us into the abyss. Now, with Data Analysis and Visualization still in the works, the adventure wasn’t over. Because what’s data science without some surprises and flashy charts to flex? For future students? Take it later in the diploma, enjoy the mad ride, and remember—even if you bomb a project, there can always be a comeback. TDS is tough, but resilience matters more than perfection. Even if you get 10/100(which I got) on a project, learn from it, adapt, and come back stronger. Massive thanks to @s.anand sir for making this learning experience possible, and a special shoutout to @carlton sir, @Saransh_Saini sir, and @Jivraj for patiently resolving our chaotic issues . Your guidance made a challenging journey both rewarding and insightful. Grateful for everything! TDS—difficult, enlightening, and totally worth it. (This gracious furry benefactor granted us a deadline extension—P1 survivors can relate #thanks_to_carlton_sir, we know how crucial that was. So, signing off with a furry and really grateful thank you! ) image190×190 35.7 KB Bro led us like prime Lebron @21f2000709 honestly, HONESTLY, IT WAS ALL YOU and @trebhuvansb and @ItsMeAlex Thanks for this course . Legit. The BEST COURSE HANDS DOWN, I HAVE EVER DONE IN MY LIFE! @s.anand @s.anand @carlton @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini",

This course builds the confidence within a person to face challenging scenarios and a believe to come at the top of it. Honestly, I learnt a lot about being a TA in this course. It was an experience worth living. So, thank you Shivaditya, looking at students like you, it feels like our efforts paid off. All the best for your next term. Best Wishes Saransh Saini TDS TA",

          "content": "This course was the most exciting and memorable of all the courses I have taken so far (actually of all the courses in the diploma level, I have completed all by now ). I had the technical background and as @22f3000819 mentioned I thought it was going to be an easy ride but I was wrong. It was challenging as well as fun at the same time. The best part of the course is that it is open internet and we are free to explore, use LLMs and get the things done. This way of learning to me is the most effective. I have the guide and now I can devise how I should approach the things. Everything ROE, Project 1, Project 2 was quite challenging and fun at the same time. Projects were the best part of the course. I learned how things can go wrong when we deploy it. I collaborated with @ItsMeAlex , @trebhuvansb , @23f1002382 and @22f3002933 for Project 2. My Project 2 repo even got 17 forks and 4 stars and scored 20/20 on evaluation. This adventure ended with the relaxing end term paper and an overall “S” grade. Also I must say the support team of TDS is the best so far in the program. I had conversation with @Jivraj , @Saransh_Saini and @carlton sir and they are super helpful. I would really miss these sessions. I attended the live sessions by @s.anand sir and sir’s take on the questions were really insightful and even made me think differently than my perspective. When we do something different it ought to have challenges both operational and technical but the TDS support team tried to give its best. Many a times I too had raised concerns but the team tried to resolve it to their best capabilities. At last I would like to say, without any hesitation, I had experienced the best part of the program till now in the last 3-4 months. Hoping to meet the team and my fellow peers in person during the Paradox . Thanks & Regards Pradeep Mondal",

          "content": "My TDS Journey “A Tale of Bugs, Chaos & Miraculous Comebacks” So, I did something bold (or reckless, depends on how you see it)—took the TDS (Tools in Data Science) course right in my first term. Why? Because curiosity got the better of me, and I thought, “Eh, GA1 went fine, how hard could it be?” (Spoiler: Very hard.) Not a decision I recommend unless you’re into academic masochism. The first few modules hit me like three courses merged into one . Maybe because I was totally unprepared, maybe because TDS has a secret pact with chaos. Did all 7 GA …it was very time consuming but fun too …learnt new tools with every question. But hey, the live lectures were fantastic , the modules were well-structured , and thank goodness for the lifesaving Discourse forum and group, where the real MVPs reside . Then came Project 1. Ah yes, my nemesis. I’d write code, it would run perfectly, then—bam! A random error just to keep things from getting doable⚠️. Was it 404? 500? Who knows! I basically developed muscle memory for every error code in existence . The grand result? 2/20. At this point, my grade looked like it had fallen off a cliff , and I wasn’t sure if I could salvage an B—or even a C, honestly… with -18 in my balance due to P1 and a trauma for P2 I couldn’t have expected more… no? Entered the TA sessions and peer-powered survival squad —my saving grace. ROE, the supposedly impossible exam, where I thought even a 50% would be a miracle?..got 100%. Same for Project 2—100%. Even after initially refusing to believe it, reality set in, and my **end-term score also landed around 90 ** (thanks to the PYQs and those 300 github ques…definitely recommending the next term student to solve and understand all the pyqs fr), then wrapping the final score with some gift wrappers of a few bonus marks… this deal got sealed with a confident A … .…drumrolls… An A. This course was brutal, but in the best way possible . It threw me into battles with LLMs, never-ending questions, and existential crises over debugging . But now, I have actual skills (and scars) that I’ll carry into my future projects of MAD1, MAD2, MLP, and BDM which will be a whole new experience🚀. Looking back, the syllabus was a wild mix of survival skills and superpowers—building models, deploying them, wrestling with LLMs, and somehow convincing messy data to behave. And just when we thought we had conquered it all, Project 1 pulled us into the abyss. Now, with Data Analysis and Visualization still in the works, the adventure wasn’t over. Because what’s data science without some surprises and flashy charts to flex? For future students? Take it later in the diploma, enjoy the mad ride, and remember—even if you bomb a project, there can always be a comeback. TDS is tough, but resilience matters more than perfection. Even if you get 10/100(which I got) on a project, learn from it, adapt, and come back stronger. Massive thanks to @s.anand sir for making this learning experience possible, and a special shoutout to @carlton sir, @Saransh_Saini sir, and @Jivraj for patiently resolving our chaotic issues . Your guidance made a challenging journey both rewarding and insightful. Grateful for everything! TDS—difficult, enlightening, and totally worth it. (This gracious furry benefactor granted us a deadline extension—P1 survivors can relate #thanks_to_carlton_sir, we know how crucial that was. So, signing off with a furry and really grateful thank you! ) image190×190 35.7 KB",

Further more I would like to ask that there is no grace marks to pass the score while other subjects have some policy. Due to some issues I couldn’t study well and I didn’t pass the course with only 1.5 marks. Due to high fees and I do not fall under any Fees relaxation policy. So please sir I would like to request for a better decision. So that I would end up my Diploma by next term. It’s a kind request sir to look into it and please help me out. If I pass this course I would end my diploma by next term. I cannot add two image files Screenshot (2374)449×748 34.9 KB @carlton @Jivraj Screenshot (2373)1920×1080 144 KB The scores in the email are correct. The scores on the dashboard are correct. But the total is wrong in the dashboard. It looks like an website/operations issue. Have you checked the dashboard again? There was a problem earlier, and i was told it was corrected. If it has been corrected then let us know. If not I will refer it to operations. On our end everything is correct. Its a portal problem. Kind regards No Sir, It is the same and please help me with the grace marks to pass the course. I only need 1.5 marks. Please sir Help me with it. @carlton Sir Did you Found any solution regarding this because there is no change in the Dashboard. Hi Utkarsh, Even if the marks change to your actual marks, operations will not give the 1.5 marks for passing, but I am more concerned about the difference in the dashboard, because it might affect some others as well. So thanks for letting us know. Thank you sir for addressing it. Sir If possible please let me know if I want to request someone who grant me. So whom can I Contact. @jkmadathil is the only one who you can contact regarding this matter. I’ve already spoken to him about your particular case. Hi Utkarsh, Once again I want to thank you for raising the issue. There was an operational error and it is being dealt with. You might see a grade change along with several students. Kindest regards Greetings sir , @jkmadathil I am a diploma student currently in the last term of this level but due to Grade U, I wouldn’t be able to complete this level by next term. I only 1.5 grace marks to pass this course. I didn’t knew the difficulty of this course because the rating of this course on discourse is wrong. So I took this subject but wasn’t able to give proper time to it. Somehow I managed to do the course but due to only 1.5 marks, I am not able to pass the course. I have only 4 course left, So if I pass this course I’ll be able to complete diploma by next term. Further sir, I do not fall under any fees relaxation policy, So sir I have to pay the same fees again for the same course. So it’s a huge request sir to grant me some grace marks to pass the course. If the difference was more I wouldn’t request at all. Even sir in the last term I repeated MLT because the difference was high and I couldn’t make it but I managed to pass it in this term. Sir I request you grant me some grace marks. My score is 38.6 so If you grant me 1 marks and round it off. then sir I’ll be able to pass it and will finish diploma by next term. Sir it is huge request sir. Please consider it as exception and sir this will be my last request because I respect your decision and will not make any further request. Thank you sir sincere regards",

WSL (if you are using windows) is usually a good option to do that because many of the tools are primarily linux tools. This does not mean you cannot use another os.

I understand that it’s difficult for you as well to take extra sessions because there are already multiple classes scheduled every day. Just one request—if possible, it would be great if you could live stream the session on 15th May, so I can watch it after attending the MLF session. Otherwise, the recorded session usually takes some time to be uploaded. If it’s not possible, no problem at all, Sir—I’ll manage. We cant live stream, because we have an AI processing pipeline that we need to use before upload. But we are trying to get the workflow to the point where it is available within 6 to 12 hours of the session being held. (We are still doing some fine tuning and working out some bugs on the automation tool - currently its a semi - manual automated process).",

Week1TDS2479×778 169 KB @22f3000680 My only comment here would be, in TDS we do not use html, css or js for creating what the user will see. For us the reason to know this is to help us extract data. We will not be creating any user frontends. For a developer, they will use these technologies to create front ends, validation etc. We leverage them for data extraction as data scientists. sqlite (or more broadly databases) again will be used purely from a data extraction perspective. We will not require you to learn how to create them or modify them. The goal in TDS is not to make you a developer, but rather to understand how to leverage technologies to source, extract, transform and deploy data in a useable form, which is very different from being a software developer. Granted there are significant overlaps when you learn these technologies and tools. Being good at TDS will inevitably mean you will be significantly well equipped to create end to end solutions. Learning html, css, javascript, sql will give you the capability to develop web sites etc, but we are never going to create one and so we will not spend time learning how to build one. Nice map!

      "content": "Hi Friends, I’ve opened this thread for tracking specific doubts / points / topics that we all want our sir to cover in the session scheduled on Sunday, 18-5-25 Please keep appending your doubts here. Thanks, Prasad. I don’t know where to start… But let me share this screenshot (part of “uv” installation)… image1920×1080 302 KB Here, I really did not understand, what I’ve to do, and why? What I don’t have to do, if any? Also don’t know anything about PyPi, Cargo, how they are related to “uv”… More importantly don’t know whether this is a valid doubt or not too. More over, how to express doubts in almost every line (some times feeling shy too). As we (most of the students) are not ready to take up this course (with so many such stupid / doubts), it increases load on the instructors, TAs, and every teaching staff. From students side, this is causing lot of distress, as we struggle to raise so many doubts and get them clarified. By the team we read a line and try to understand what it means, we get another doubt. I strongly feel that “Diploma in Programming” (or set of subjects) must be made as a pre-requisite to this (TDS) course and any other such courses too. Alternatively, we have to create BRIDGE course sort of thing and make it a part of formal curriculum to reduce stress and distress in students and make teaching staff life better. I don’t know whom do I need to take this up, but request our TAs to carry our voice / message to the concerned authorities. Thanks, Prasad. Just to share my difficulty, another example I wish to share is here below… image1920×1080 197 KB As mentioned in the screenshot / instructions, I’ve downloaded “README.md” file and then tried to run the specified command “npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md | sha256sum” (I don’t know, what it means and what it does, but still blindly tried to run). I get the below error (screenshot given below). It says \"term ‘npx’ is not recognized. image1920×1080 175 KB To be honest, I don’t even know (however, based on the videos I watched, I think I’ll have to run somewhere in Linux. Is it same as “powershell”? ) where exactly I need to run the command. I’m throwing stones in dark. Unfortunately, even when I get correct answer (like Questions 1 thru 3), I don’t know what that means and what I achieved. This is frustrating (I understand how much it will frustrate our instructors, when we don’t even know what we know and what we don’t know). Some one guided me that I’ve to install Git & run these commands from Git Bash terminal. I’ve installed Git and tried to run “npx” command from there. Is this not “Git Bash” terminal? image1920×1080 115 KB This will be my last doubt posting here. Not planning to post any more doubts as our instructors by know understand, our level and how to handle us OR help us from here. Others can keep adding their own doubts as they feel necessary.

I’ve been trying to go a bit deeper into Module 1 after completing GA1, and I’ve encountered some issues while experimenting with the llm CLI tool and different models. Specifically, I tried running the following command to test the Gemini model, as shown on the Module 3 introduction page: llm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001 But I received the following error: Error: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'No auth credentials found', 'code': 401}} Initially, I had set my OpenAI key from AIPipe , but I got a “model not found” error. So I checked the available models using: llm model list At that point, the Gemini model wasn’t listed. I then installed the llm-openrouter plugin, and after that, the Gemini model appeared in the list. However, I’m now facing the above authentication error. To test if the issue was only with Gemini and other models other than OpenAI models , I created a personal API key from OpenRouter and tried running a free model:(i tried free models on both keys from AIpipe and my personal account since it doesn’t need any credits to be purchased) llm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/qwen/qwen3-8b:free This worked correctly with my OpenRouter API key, which confirms that the plugin is working fine. I’m confused about how to properly authenticate for other via AIPipe for OpenRouter using the llm CLI. I’ve been trying different approaches for the last two days but haven’t been able to resolve this. Certainly! Here’s a grammatically correct and polished version of the message you want to add at the end: I also tried setting the API keys individually for OpenAI, OpenRouter(this is basically configured while installing the plugin llm-openrouter), and even my personal keys, using the key management options mentioned in the llm documentation. Additionally, I saw that our course page suggest changing the base URL like this: export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1 llm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001 However, even this approach didn’t work for me.

Then once you realised your mistake, on Feb 17th at 9:11 pm IST i.e yesteday, you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations. Then you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=“21f3002647, post:1, topic:167471”] image250×534 3.92 KB [/quote] showing that your files are in the correct place.

      "question": "Dear @jkmadathil @Anand @Bharathi First and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TDS team in supporting us throughout this course. The live sessions and guidance have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience. However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations. Key Challenges Faced Lack of Prerequisites This course did not list any prerequisites, leading many students—including those from non-technical backgrounds—to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the course content, assignments, and projects have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage. Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure The difficulty of the projects has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to rely heavily on peer support just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully. Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback Many students joined TDS based on past Discourse posts and feedback, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for working professionals and students without prior experience. Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs) While we have put in significant effort—spending 2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs) to secure good scores—we still find ourselves struggling to meet expectations for the projects and RoE, which are significantly harder than anticipated. We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course. We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed. Thank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.",
      "answer": "Thank you @A_LAKSHMI for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response. Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the grading pattern will not be changed. And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP. TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words: This course is quite hard Here’s students’ feedback: It used to be an easy course until 2024. # # # Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # # Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # # LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # # The ROE is hard. # Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you’re ready for this course. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now. TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help Again to quote Anand: We encourage learning by sharing You CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam). Why should you copy? Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well. To learn well, understand what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize. To learn better, teach what you’ve learnt. Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself). Once again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable and internally make us more humble. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them. @22f2001640 Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.",

I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution. 1. Graded Assignments (GA) GA6 Doubts Unresolved: While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. (Thread link) GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. 2. Project Updates Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 2: There are multiple doubts posted in the Project 2 discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved? (thread link) 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard.

      "answer": "lakshaygarg654: GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations. With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS. GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon. lakshaygarg654: Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing. Each and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway. lakshaygarg654: 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. You got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed. Kind regards",

      "answer": "23f2004636: From the information in the email, I infer that students who complete the additional reviews are eligible for bonus marks, which will be added to their overall total marks. This is correct. 23f2004636: Earning additional bonus marks is certainly a challenging milestone, and we understand that it requires considerable effort. This is also correct. 23f2004636: Unfortunately, I can’t follow the instructions because I did not receive the email about submitting extra peer reviews, as it appears to have been sent to those who participated in GA7 The mail you have pasted has definitely come from one of your peer in the course. You can try clicking the form, evaluation criteria for reviews have been provided in the form itself. If in further doubt, try doing one review with the peer who shared the email. Now try answering Q5. And in case you have more doubts, you can refer to the live session that happened today. I believe most of it was spent on clarifying what the bonus is for. 23f2004636: Please note that I ask this purely for clarification and with the utmost respect for the professors and the grading system, as I have no intention of creating controversy. I simply wish to understand the criteria. Completely understand. And we too are trying to help you understand the criteria through these discussions. And believe me, we are also learning in the process.",

      "answer": "It is good to see that you have been actively collaborating with your peers and both have benefitted from this. Here is the main query that most people are having: 23f2004636: To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. Here is my response, and I have consulted with the course instructors before sharing this: Every term in TDS, both instructors and students are not aware of what bonuses are going to be given out at the start of term. Bonus activities are created at any point, at the discretion of the course team, and the information is not disseminated in a wide fashion. It’s primarily a reward mechanic for those that really are interested in engaging in the whole breadth of the course. For instance, in the last two terms the bonus activities required them to post their solutions in Discourse where the problem statement. The course team do not invent GAs for the sake of giving opportunities for scoring marks. They are opportunities to learn and put that learning to use. Another goal is for the GAs to be opportunities to learn by collaborating with each other. 192 students took that opportunity to engage with GA7. If no one is interested in doing the GA, then why should the team take the effort to create it? Would you rather prefer that we make it mandatory for all students to do all GAs (by making GAA = average of all GA Scores)? Some courses do that. We were very lenient in our GA scoring because the course is tough. Students benefitted from that leniency. Should we reverse our leniency so that everyone “gets the opportunity to get bonus marks?” Think about this As a course team, they did not know beforehand that they were going to give opportunities for any bonuses when GA 7 was created. So there was no information to give. Please do understand that the course team do not knowingly hide things from students (that’s a viewpoint that some students seem to suggest with their posts or at least). When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence? It is extraordinary that it appears you would prefer if those students, who actually put in the effort, would not be given the opportunity! You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. They thought it was worth the effort before there was any chance of a bonus. And now you begrudge them that reward for their own diligence. Once again reiterating this point - Bonus marks are given for activities to students at the discretion of the course team. It always has been. And it has never been widely available to all students in past terms of TDS either. This term is no exception. They are never decided beforehand. They are created as and when there seems to be an appropriate opportunity to reward students for their effort. The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. But it’s not guaranteed for them either. They have to put in a significant coordinated effort with their peers to actually achieve that. In other words, it’s not a freebie. I had promised to provide the distribution of people who did GA7 both in terms of number of assignments done and average score in GAA. Here is the data below: # Assignments Done # students 0 42 1 33 2 22 3 19 4 23 5 28 Assignment_Score # students 0-10 75 11-20 19 21-30 15 31-40 9 41-50 13 51-60 7 61-70 11 71-80 12 81-90 10 91-100 17",
